            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue viewed &amp; peruſed exactly a certaine ſmale vollume publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by Sir Humfrey Linde. He intituleth it <hi>the ſafe way,</hi> but I finde it containes nothing either ſafe or ſound. To make it more plauſible he giues it a Latin inſcripton printing in the front of it, <hi>via tuta,</hi> not much vnlike to the practiſe of Mountibanks, who to make their pouders more vendible ſet on their boxes ſtrange titles to perſuade the ignorant, they are farre fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched &amp; of care vertue. He calleth it <hi>a waie lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alle Chriſtians to the true Catholike Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But indeede it is no waye but rather a diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, or diuerſion: or if it be a way, its onely a by-way leading ſinple ſoules into woods &amp; deſerts &amp; leauing them there vnmercifully to be deuoured by rauenous beaſts. If it be any way at all, it is not <hi>via tuta,</hi> but rather <hi>via torta,</hi> &amp; a Kinde of negatiue way conſiſting in nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true Catholike way, &amp; therefore as according to the doctrine of Ariſtotle, <hi>negatio eſt malignantis naturoe, negation is of a malignant
<pb facs="tcp:2119:3"/> nature,</hi> ſo it being a negatiue way, it cannot poſſible be any other then <hi>via, malignantium, the way of the malignant &amp; reprobate people.</hi> He addes it <hi>leadeth to the true auncient &amp; Catholike faith now profeſſed in the Church of England,</hi> but this confirmeth that which I ſaid before, that his way is no true way but a by-way as leading to a by-place, to a Countrie &amp; people ſeparated from the reſt of the world, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tote diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus orbe Britannus.</hi>
                     </note> conducting to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diuided from the reſt of the earth, as in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation ſo is it ſeparated in Religion from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yea from it ſelfe, from the trueth, from antiquitie, as being no more auncient in all poynts then the daies of Queene Elizabeth as her 39. articles plainely teſtifie, diuerſe of them being firſt proclaimed by her &amp; her parliament: hither the way leadeth &amp; there it leaueth the poore traueller at a <hi>non plus,</hi> without any meanes to paſſe vnto Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith farther in the title that euen the Romaniſts <hi>his aduerſaries doe testifie,</hi> the ſafety of his way: but this is moſt ridiculous &amp; moſt falſe of all the reſt of his inſcription; he citeth indeed greate tropes of authors in pretenſe of his poſitions, ſome of which are true Catholike writers, but others not acknowledged for ſuch by vs, others maniſtly knowen to be his owne conſectaries: &amp; all thoſe that are truly ours, he doth eyther malitiouſly, or ignorantly abuſe, &amp; ſo doth but make checker-worke or Croſſe
<pb facs="tcp:2119:3"/> lines of them alto gether for his miniſters to play in the pulpit with their parishioners at fox &amp; geeſe.</p>
                  <p>I imagin'd his name had bene Line, but now I perceiue certainely it is not, for he vſeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther line nor ſquare in his booke, I meane nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther method nor ſquare dealing. For ſetting aſide his prologue &amp; Epilogue, his firſt chapter, or ſection might aſwell haue bene the laſt &amp; the laſte his firſt as otherwiſe, &amp; as for his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, it is not to be found, either in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, midle or ending: wherefore if his name be Linde as he ſubſcribeth, it is more agreeable to the inſide of his worke, which is very well linde indeede I meane with lies. And the trueth is the greateſt part of his pamphlet is but ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne brokery ſtuffe, dropped from <hi>whites way</hi> &amp; <hi>B. Mourtons</hi> patched <hi>Appeale,</hi> forged <hi>Imposture,</hi> &amp; vshers outrages, excepting ſome frenchwares taken out of the corrupted ſtore houſe of that famous mountibanke <hi>Daniel Chamiere,</hi> with whom I perceaue his worship hath had no ſmale coreſpondence.</p>
                  <p>He ſtileth himſelfe knight which no doubt he is, but as that title ſoundes honeſtie, honor, and nobillitie, ſo none of that I finde in his booke, which is ſo replenishsd with bragges, boaſts, and proteſtations, as one would ſweare him rather to be a proteſting puritan, then a pure Proteſtant.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2119:4"/>
                  <p>Which with other reaſons moue me to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the booke is not his, but a miniſterial ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard fathered vpon his nobilitie for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authoritie of the worke: but that I will not much examine: onely this I ſay that when I had read it, I did ſoma't doubt whether the knight could be ſo verſed in our Roman di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines as (thou' to little purpoſe) the penner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeres to be: which cauſed me to ſuſpect the true authour is ſome one of greater reading and induſtrie then I imagin Sir Humfrey is: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Spuria multorum patrum proles.</hi>
                     </note> yet on the other ſide I am verelie perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that conſidering the multitude of ignorant abſurdities it conteines; the authour of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a man of any ſollide learning in diuinity, which being ſuppoſed, I cannot abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Sir Humfrey for taking vpon him the name, yet he cannot be iudged wholely excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in his honor for that he conſented to be the putatiue Father of ſo baſe a bratte.</p>
                  <p>This which I haue is the third edition, &amp; the fourth may be dailie expected, in regard the booke is ſo full of matter, I meane of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yet after the contents come once to be exactely diſcuſſed &amp; diſcouered, I perſuade my ſelfe it will quikly looſe it vndeſerued credit, &amp; the dubtleſſe if the leaues were larger it would ride poaſte to Tobaconiſtis, &amp; groſſers shops.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe Sir Humfrey I am Tom. Teltruth who cannot flatter or diſſemble: yet may you
<pb facs="tcp:2119:4"/> aſſure your ſelfe that altho' my ſpeeche be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily directed vnto your ſelfe, my intent is directly to reprooue thoſe onelie who in their contriuing of the worke for you, &amp; in your name, haue ſo profanely miſapplyed, &amp; abuſed ſacred ſcriptures, ancient Fathers, &amp; an num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other graue &amp; Catholike authors ſo corruptedlie produced againſt their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed faith. Neyther yet haue I anie meaning by my words to offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the dignitie of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which I reſpect in the higheſt degree of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, as neither the perſons of thoſe who truely are the authors of the worke, &amp; haue deceiued both you &amp; others: but rather with charitable S. Aug. I chiuſe to ſay of you &amp; euery one of my aduerſaries in religion: <hi>Homo viuat, moriatur error.</hi> Let the man liue, the error dye.</p>
                  <p>But now I will deſcend to particulars, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due examine paſſe my ſentence vpon euerie ſeuerall ſection, cheefelie inſiſting in diſcuſſion of the citations of the aduerſarie, dedicating my whole cenſure not to the gentrie of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie as Sir Humfrey doth, and of whoſe mature Iudgments I can not conceiue ſo baſely as once to imagin they will be dangerouſlie enamored with his booke, but I will cheefelie offer it to the more vulgar ranke of people who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſmaler tallents may more eaſely be circumuented, whom if by conferring the one booke with the other I shall vnderſtand they
<pb facs="tcp:2119:5"/> come to be right informed of the trueth, I shall hould my ſelfe ſufficientlie rewarded by them as by thoſe whoſe wauering mindes I onely intend to rectifie by my labors, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for anie matter of ſubſtance I finde in the booke, I profeſſe I should neuer haue eſteemed it worth the paines I haue taken in the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2119:11"/> there ought to be loue &amp; vnion betwene them as betwene <hi>two ſiſters deſcending from one and the ſame catholique and vniuerſall mother</hi> as he calleth her, yet as it were with one &amp; the ſame, breath he accuſeth the ſame Roman Church to haue beene the onely cauſe of ſeparation; and carrieth the buſines in ſuch a rough and vncivill fashion towards her, giuing her ſuch greate occaſions of new diſguſts, that it plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeereth he doth rather demonſtrate his owne bitterneſſe &amp; rancour towards her, then with any probable argument shew any ſuch diſpoſition to remaine in her againſt any ſuch vnion as hee pretendeth to deſire. Why then doth S. Humfrey complaine of that which is in a farre worſe manner practiſed by himſelfe and his owne brothers? beſides this I pray you doth the ſuppoſed bitterneſſe of F. Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pian proue the bitterneſſe of the Roman Church? could he alone bee the whole Roman Church who was but one onely member of it? Or are his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eches or priuate poſitions to be attributed to the whole Church, he being but one parte the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof and yet not the greateſt? what a falſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie</hi> is this? if the head of the Church had vſed ſuch ſpeeches you would haue ſeemed to haue had ſome reaſon to haue attributed them to the whole, becauſe that which the head doth may induce a denomination vppon the reſt of the body, of which examples may be found e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2119:11"/> in nature, but whatſoeuer any other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doth, it cannot rightly be attributed to the whole. So that we now ſee that in this allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion S. Humfrey himſelfe doth ſo carrie the matter, and giueth the Church of Roome euen in this ſame ſection, ſo much occaſion of new diſguſts as beſides the rehearſed calumnies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xing her <hi>with creation of</hi> 12. <hi>new Articles and coyning of new expoſitions vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ould, farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the doctrine of the Apostles,</hi> and that <hi>she mayntaineth and practiſeth manifeſt idolatry.</hi> And the like moſt falſe and ſlanderous expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations, that as I ſaid before, it plainely appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that he hath rather demonſtrated his owne bitternes, and rancour towards the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, then shewed any ſuch defect in her, by any argument drowen from Father Campians wordes by him produced, which wordes allthough by his quotation of Iewell in the margent he will ſeeme to haue taken them at ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hand, yet certainely it is a plaine impoſture, and ſo let them diuide it as they pleaſe betwixt themſelues, it being euer ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that S. Humfrey, and his Iewell, are of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall authoritie with the Catholiks, I meane of none at all. Moreouer S. Humfteys whole drift in this ſection being to cleere his owne Church from the infamous brand of Apoſtacy, he impoſeth the whole cauſe of ſeparation vpon the Roman Church, and produceth Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2119:12"/> for a wittnes of the ſame, <hi>who being dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unded</hi> (for ſooth) <hi>of the duke of Saxonie what was Luthers</hi> capitall offence <hi>that ſtirred vp ſo many oppoſites against him, made anſwer that Luther had committed two greate crimes, for he had taken away the Crowne from the Pope, and had taken downe the belly of the monkes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which ſaying of anſwer that Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus is no competent wittnes againſt the Roman Church, eſpecially in a caſe where his ſole teſtimonie is interpoſed. <hi>And if S. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> had ben circumſpect he would not haue cited Eraſmus his anſwere for this purpoſe, as containing one manifeſt lye if not twb. For neither did Luther euer take the Crowne from the Pope, which as the world knowes, he ſtill enioyeth maugre him and all his adherents: neither did Luther euer take downe the bellies of the monkes, except it was by iniuſte vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rapin to fill his owne, and to leade his lyfe in luxurious concubinate with breach of his vowes to god and man.</p>
                     <p>Immediately before this momicall paſſage of Luther out of Eraſmus (which although S. Humfrey produced to colour the pretended Reformers diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Church of Rome, yet doth it farre more ſtrongly argue a cauſe in the Pope iuſtely to reiect them, then anie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of their prepoſterous ſeparation) before this I ſay he cited a place out of the Prophet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2119:12"/> Oſe which becauſe it makes nothing to this purpoſe, <note place="margin">Cap. 4.15.17.</note> but onely vpon his owne falſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that the Roman Church is wicked and idolatrous; therefore vntill I ſee him prooue his ſuppoſition, which yet I know he will neuer be able to performe, I leaue it as impertinent: as alſo I omit the examples he brings of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams departure out of Caldea, and of the Iewes out of Egypt; which are as farre from the caſe we treate of, as Egypt is from Europe or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome from Iewrye. Therefore I will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue notice to the reader how groſſely he abuſeth certaine authours he cytes, to teſtifye that by Babylon is meant the Chriſtian Rome. For ther is not one of thoſe authours that affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes that after it was conuerted to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, it was called Babylon, according as the ſcripture vſually ſpeakes of Babylon either properly or Metaphorically. Neither is ther likewiſe anie of the ſame authours which teach, that ſince the conuerſion of that Citye to the faith of Chriſt, Chriſtians ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from it, as out of a ſpirituall and idolatrous Babylon, which is that our aduerſarie here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendes to proue, or at the leaſt ought to proue, if anie thing he meanes to prooue againſt the Romaniſts.</p>

                     <p>Now as for the moderne authours to wit Oroſius, Viues, Bellarmin, and Baronius, and Ribera, they are all knowne Romaniſts yea and ſome of them cheefe defendours of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church and faith, and ſo it is euident by this reaſon alone that they had not ſuch a thought as to meane by Babylon the Roman Church. <note place="margin">Cap. 22.</note> Viues vpon the 18. booke de cuit.

                     <p>And hence alſo the reader may gather how weakely the knight proceeds in this his firſt ſection, which is the introduction to the reſt, in regarde that by indeuouring to reprooue his aduerſarie, he doth vnaduiſedly prooue his owne imperfections, and ſo doubtleſſe he had better beene idle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ill occupyed. And I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſuade my ſelfe, that if the Archflamen had duely examined the contents of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he doubtleſſe would haue marked it with a, <hi>non imprimatur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In his ſecond ſection S. Humfrey pretends to prooue <hi>the cauſe of contention betwixt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> and his owne, <hi>originally to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Romaniſts by their owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Thus much he promiſeth in the title, but performeth nothing. For he cytes but three onely authours, that is, Caſſander, Camde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Ceſenas, in fauor of his poſition, and yet none of them are acknowledged by vs for ſounde
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2119:14"/> Romaniſts, at the leaſt if we reſpect their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings here produced. And of Caſſander both the inquiſitors in their Index, and Bellarmin in his Controuerſies, ſufficiently declare the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundnes of his doctrine and religion. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den I hope is well knowe. Now for Ceſenas notwithſtanding S. Humfrey ſtiles him Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Franciſcans, as indeed once he was though afterwards depoſed by his owne order and excommunicated by Pope Iohn the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> for his pertinacie and malapert manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, that the Fryes of his order could haue no rents or poſſeſſions, yet if he writ againſt the Tyrannie of the Pope, as he is quoted by the kinght, it is moſt manifeſt he could not be a perfect Romaniſt: or at leaſt that worke could not be his, as in truch I am perſuaded it was not, but falſely fathered vpon him, through the iniquitie of him who malitiouſly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>the myſterie of iniquitie,</hi> againſt the Pope and Roman Church. And hauing now examined the matter I perceiue that which Ceſenas writ or Ockam for him was not againſt the Popes in generall: but he writ onely an epiſtle or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe (if anie thing he writ him ſelfe) againſt the errors (as he termes them) of Pope Iohn in particular, with whome he was much diſguſted by reaſon of the foreſaid buſines and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications. And as for the wordes which S. Humfrey cites touching two Churches, one
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2119:14"/> good, and an other euill, I fynde none ſuch, nor anie others to that ſenſe in Ceſenas. And if euer he vttered anie ſuch wordes, which according to his whole diſcourſe is wholely improbable, yet doubtleſſe he could not meane, that the euill Church was the Roman Church intirely and abſolutely, in regarde his owne wordes in his foreſaide worke doe euidently declare, that he ſubiected him ſelfe to the ſame euen in this ſame buſines, ſaying in his letters to the Generall Chapter of his Order: <note place="margin">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2119:17"/> officers in collecting the almes or contribution of the people vppon the graunt and gayning of them, gaue ſcandall to faithfull Chriſtians, as appeareth by the very ſame wordes which he himſelfe citeth, <note place="margin">Vide Con.

Another vntruth he hath in the 22. pa. where he ſaith thus: <hi>neither did thoſe men</hi> (meaning the Fathers of the Councell of Trent) <hi>ſeeke a reformation in manners onely, but in the doctrine it ſelfe.</hi> Whereas they in that very place by the knight alledged, wish onely that the priuate maſſe might be reſtored to the auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the communion of the people, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the prieſt, which as you knowe is no matter of doctrine in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie betweene the Romaniſts and the reformers, but onely of practiſe, and conſequently it proueth not the knights intent in this place, but rather his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant miſtaking of the true ſtate of the queſtion in that pointe of controuerſie about priuate maſſe. Now that which he addeth of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin ſeruice in the Roman Church to wit that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2119:17"/> the Councell commaunds all Paſtours that they at the Maſſe doe frequently interpret and declare vnto the people the miſtery of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, who doth not ſee how impertinent it is to the matter of doctrine, and how vnapt a medium it is to proue that the Doctours of the Councell either did ſeeke reformation in the ſame, or to shew <hi>how neare the ſame doctours came to the doctrine of the reformed Churches,</hi> as he preſently addeth, affirming them ſo to doe, ſince the Councell proceedeth not there, by way of definition or decree in matter of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but onely by way of ordinance and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund as the wordes by him ſelfe rehearſed doe plainely ſpecifie; &amp; yet not ſo but that the ſame Councell, and in the ſame place doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſely commaund, or at the leaſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Maſſe ought to be for the moſt part celebrated in the lattin tongue.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer touching equiuocations, certaine it is that he doth equiuocate in his allegation of <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> out of the Councell of <hi>Piſa,</hi> where he ſaith that <hi>the Pope promiſed ſolemnely to intend the reformation of the Church,</hi> whereas in truth Alexander meaneth not of the faith of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, as the knight would haue it, but of the reformation of manners, or of ſome abuſes practized in the Church by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons.

And yet more then this ſuppoſe the relation were moſt true and authenticall, yet doth it not proue Sir Humfreys intent, videli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet that the Pope denieth reformatlon of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in faith and manners, for that in the wordes related out of the foreſaid hiſtory, there is no mention of any corruptions of that nature, but onely of abuſes in generall tearmes, which Schomberg was of opinion that it had beene better to let them alone, yet that was onely his particular dictamen and propoſition, to which neither the Pope nor the reſt of the Councell agreed, but reſolued, vpon a courſe of reformation as the decrees themſelues doe teſtifie: ſo that this paſſage of the related hiſtorie is impertinentlie alledged by the Knight.</p>
                     <p>Finally S. Humfrey doth equiuocate not onely in that which we haue ſaid, but alſoe in the very ſubſtance of this his whole ſection. For his cheefe or rather whole ſcope being not onely to proue corruptions in doctrine and manners to be confeſſed by the Romaniſts to be in their Church, but alſo that the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to take them away, he by his allegations of the teſtimonies of ſome Romaniſts proueth in parte that there were corruptions in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners both before and when the Councell of

And ſo out of thoſe proceedings of Sir Humfrey and the reſt which hath bene ſaid it may plainely appeere that he is ſo farre from recouery of that honour which he loſt in the former ſections, that he hath now ſtained the ſame not a little more, and ſo we may conclude this ſection and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it in the former cenſure.</p>

And this I ſay euen in caſe it were true that all thoſe ſeuen had euer renounced the Romish faith either in part or totally, as the knight affirmeth; which neuertheleſſe I will make apparent to be otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>And firſt touching the Councell of Baſil, the very ſame wordes which Sir Humfrey ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth do conuince the ſame, for ſaith hee the Councell <hi>did allow the cup to the Bohemians vpon this condition: that they should not find fault with the contrary vſe, nor ſeuer themſelues from the Catholike Church.</hi> Now what is heere to be found in theſe wordes of the Councell which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2119:20"/> is any kinde of renuntiation of the Romish faith? nay what is there which concerneth the Romish faith at all? that which the Councell determineth being but onelie a graunt to one particular nation vpon particular reaſons, and that in a point of practice not of doctrine, which alſo, if our English proteſtants were as conformable to the Roman Church in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points of faith and manners as the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians then were, might perhaps vpon the like iuſt reaſons and vpon the ſame condition be graunted in the realme of England, and that without any preiudice to either faith or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But our English ſectaries are ſo farre from conformitie to the Romaniſts not onely in diuerſe other points but euen in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually exclaime againſt them both in their bookes and ſermons as violatours of Chriſts inſtitution in that they do not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and in euerie countrie communicate the people in both kindes, <note place="margin">Con.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2119:21"/> rather againſt himſelfe by producing the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid teſtimonie, of the Councell of Baſil in which noe renuntiation of Popery is to be founde nor anie agreement in doctrine or manners with the pretenſiue reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. From whence it is alſo conſequentlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that to be clearelie falſe which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie affirmes in the beginning of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to wit that <hi>the reformed Churches haue done nothing in this otherwiſe then former Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels had anciently decreed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He citeth in the ſecond place <hi>Aeneas Syluius,</hi> who was afterwardes Pope Pius the ſecond, as if he had renounced the Romish religion in that he ſaith, <hi>that as marriage vpon weightie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons was taken from the Prieſts, ſo vpon weightie reaſons it were wished to be reſtored.</hi> But what is this to the purpoſe? is a wish of an alteration in one particular point, &amp; that not in faith but manners or rather in practice of the Church a renuntiation of religion either in parte or in whole? or is the prohibition of marriage, or the celibate or ſingle life of prieſts anie of the twelue articles which the knight is pleaſed to tearme the new creede of the Roman Church? no ſuerlie. How then is it a matter of faith, or the renunciation of it the renuntiation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie? and not rather a renuntiation onelie of a precept of the Church in caſe it were truelie renounced by anie Romaniſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2119:21"/> he is. Which renuntiation neuertheleſſe was neuer made by the authour cited as his wordes rehearſed out of Platina by Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey himſelfe doe make manifeſt to anie ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and vnpartiall reader. In which not by way of wish or as giuing his reall aſſent with the reformers as Sir Humfrey doth corrupted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate, but onelie by a doutfull deliuerie of his owne priuate dictamen that preſent tyme occurring vnto him. <hi>Sacerdotibus magna ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ſublatas nuptias, maiori reſtituendas vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deri.</hi> Plat. in pio 2. And yet more then that after he was Pope and making reflection vpon his former writings published in his greener yeares, to the imitation of S. Auguſtin and others he framed are tractation of diuers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars paſſages of his owne workes among which this is one, as appeares by the tenor of the ſame which in his later editions in force of a breefe or Bull is vſually prefixed to his boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. To omitte that if the foreſaid <hi>Syluius</hi> had bene a renouncer of anie point of Poperie it were too ridiculous to imagin that euer he would haue bene elected Pope, as neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the knight confeſſeth him to haue bene afterwardes. And thus the reader may plainelie ſee that this allegation is of no more force then the former towards the proofe of Sir Humfreys intent.</p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:2119:22"/>
                     <p>In the next place is maſter <hi>Harding</hi> brought in for a renoncer of Popery. For that as Iewell reporteth, he ſaith that <hi>godly and faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue ſince the time of the Primitiue Church much complained of Priuate Maſſe.</hi> But ſuppoſe it were true, what is this to the purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of Popery? For what zealous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Papiſt is there in the world who doth not iuſtly complaine of want of deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the laity for that they haue not that feruour in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the communion which thoſe of the Primitiue Church had? and if this could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied what Romaniſt would not much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, yea and by all meanes poſſible procure it? but is this to condemne as vnlawfull or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſts inſtitution (as you ſectaries doe) all Maſſes as be celebrated without Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants? no ſuch matter. No more, nay much leſſe then if for complaining that Sir Humfrey Linde doth not deale ſo ſincerely in the citations of his aduerſaries as becometh the reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a knight, a man should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſently be thought to haue quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him of dishoneſt proceeding in that nature euen in the higheſt degree of falſe dealing and corruption. Which collection if he pleaſe to graunt, I know not who will be ſo vnciuill as to contradict him. Eſpeciallie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that euen in this verie citation he hath corrupted doctour Harding moſt vnconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablie
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2119:22"/> by applying againſt priuate maſſe that which he ſpeakes onelie againſt the negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the laye people for that they ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie omit to communicate at maſſe, as if that authour diſalowed of the priuate maſſe it ſelfe, whoſe wordes neuertheleſſe truelie cited as he hath them in the beginning of the ninth leafe of his anſwer to Iewels chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge will cleare the buſines and manifeſtlie diſcouer where the fault lyeth: <hi>that others do commonlie forbeare ſaith hee, to communicate with the preiſt it is through their owne faulte and negligence not regarding their owne ſaluation whereof the godly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rulers of faithfull people haue ſince the tyme of the primitiue Church allwayes much complained.</hi> And thus you ſee how nimblie the ſubtil knight hath abuſed both that worthy doctour &amp; his owne reader. Wherefore it being by this which we haue ſaid apparent that <hi>M. Harding</hi> was no condemner of priuate maſſe as either vnlawfull or againſt the inſtitution of Chriſt, it alſo is thence manifeſtlie conſequent that he was no renouncer of Poperie euen in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular point, and ſo the proofe which the knight would draw from him is of no force, nor auaileable to his cauſe; nay it is in trueth ſo diſagreeable to the ſtate of the queſtion that it is no ſmall wonder how either mallice or ignorance could ſo much blinde him as to make vſe of it in this matter.</p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:2119:23"/>
                     <p>The fourth reſtimonie is out of the <hi>Rhemes Teſtament</hi> the authours of which (as hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of Cauſabon) auouch the ſcriptures to <hi>haue bene tranſlated into English by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of the heretiks.</hi> And he addeth <hi>that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts haue of late graunted a diſpenſation to ſome men and woemen alſo to reade ſcriptures, and this</hi> alſo <hi>was done</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>by the importunitie of the heretiks.</hi> Moreouer as it were in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame, he addeth that <hi>moſt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish proſelites,</hi> (as he tearmeth them) <hi>did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent their Church and ſeruice for the firſt eleuen yeeres of Queene Elizabeth: neither</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was it forbidden by any lawfull councell.</hi> Thus he diſcourſeth touching this point.</p>
                     <p>Heere is much a doe and little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And indeede after a greate deale of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die a man shall hardlie collect anie thing out of the whole diſcourſe which may ſeeme to haue anie shewe of proofe for the knights aſſertion, videlicet. <hi>That many Romaniſts haue renounced Popery before their death.</hi> Yet it ſeemes to me, his whole drift may be reduced to theſe two arguments. The firſt thus: The Romaniſts haue tranſlated the bible by the importunitie of the reformers, &amp; giue diſpenſations to ſome men and woemen to reade it; therefore many Romaniſts haue renounced Popery. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thus: moſt of the Romaniſts did frequent the reformed Church and ſeruice for the firſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2119:23"/> 11. yeeres of Queene Elizabeths reigne, neither was their communication with them prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by anie lawfull Councell, therefore manie Romaniſts renounced Popery before their death.</p>
                     <p>Loe heere two learned Enthymems: they march like two march hares and runne ſtarke wilde. I wonder what nimble vniuerſity man hath taught the knight to choppe Logike ſo minshingly, or what polipracticall Alchymiſt hath inſtructed him in the art of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo exactly, that out of the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his reformed conſorts, he is able to drawe the tranſlation of the Rhemish Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that with a diſpenſation for ſome men and woemen to reade it. So skilfull he is in extracting oyle out of ſtones and milke out of mountaines. Neither doth his exquiſite knowledge ſtay heere, but he will needes perſuade his reader he can extract alſo out of the ſame, that <hi>many Romaniſts haue renounced their</hi> Popery by tranſlating the Bible into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish and by giuing a diſpenſation to reade the ſame; nay and that which is yet more marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous he ſeemeth to glory not a little that this hath beene all effected by the importunity of his reformed brothers; as if forſooth, they had exerciſed an act of ſome heroycall virtue therein. Whereas in truth, importunity is ſo farre from deſert of commendation as it may
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2119:24"/> be much more iuſtly regiſtred in the liſt of vices then of virtues: and ſoe we ſee that in the Scripture it ſelfe the importunitie of a beggar is branded with the marke of improbity, that which I maruell, the knight being ſo greate a Bibliſt as he is, did not reflect vpon it. And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte it were true that the Romaniſts moued by the importunity of the ſectaries did tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the Bible into the vulgar tongue for the laitie to reade, by what rule of Logike I pray you Sir Humfrey doth it follow that many Romaniſts haue renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced Popery before their death? proue but this one conſequence and I yeeld you the victory. And pray tell me what article of faith is that which teacheth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts to beleeue that the Bible ought not to be read by the laytie in no caſe, or vpon no reaſons neuer ſo weighty? or if you can finde no ſuch article, as I know you cannot, then confeſſe you haue loſt the victory in the point, confeſſe you haue proceeded weakely, confeſſe you haue by your firſt argument proued nothing: and ſo I will take that for graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and paſſe to the ſecond, which all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath ſome more ſenſe in it then the other, yet it is ſenſeleſſe enough as shall preſently appeare. For that being to proue your antecedent or firſt propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you onelie produce <hi>L. Cookes report, that most of the Romish proſelytes did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2119:24"/> your Church or ſeruice for the first eleuen yeares of Queene Elizabeth.</hi> But you muſt knowe that this authour is no competent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the Romaniſts, he is one of your owne crue, we care not for his reportes, we leaue them to the lawyers: He indeed (as you do now) preſumed to write matters of diuinity, but in that he plaied the <hi>Sutor vltra crepidam,</hi> as you doe, and ſo laboured onely to make him ſelfe ridiculous, as you doe. But let vs admit that which he reporteth, to be true, and that fome frequented your Church and ſeruice in thoſe times (as I my ſelfe haue heard they did at the leaſt in exteriour shewe, yet priuately at home frequenting Maſſe alſo,) doth it thence follow that in their minds they renounced Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery? no ſuch matter. No more then doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe of his maieſties ſubiects, who euen at this day goe to your Churches, whom neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you your ſelues hould for none of yours: but therefore doe commonly terme them <hi>Church going Papiſts.</hi> So that according to this and euen <hi>ad hominem,</hi> that is, vpon your owne Principles, your ſequel is to be condemned to be of noe force; or at the moſt out of that fact of thoſe Romaniſts which you ſpeake of, it can onely be inferred that they proceeded contrary to the profeſſion of their faith, but not that they renounced the ſame, which two things if you could haue duely diſtinguished, I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2119:25"/> verily perſuade my ſelfe you would neuer haue diſcourſed ſo friuoluſlie as you doe in this point. But now I greeue I haue ſpent ſo much time in ventilating ſo largelie ſuch chaffie ſtuffe.</p>
                     <p>After this wiſe diſcourſe Sir Humfrey paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to his owne perſuaſions, for the proofe of his aſſertion. <hi>I am verily perſuaded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that many at this day in the Church of Rome doe aſſent to our doctrine that dare not communicate with vs openly in the Church;</hi> adding an appeale to their conſciences how many of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts haue renounced Popery in thoſe diuerſe points in this place. But to this I anſwer that if Romaniſts would haue bene perſuaded by this wiſe knights motiues they had lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ago all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Poperie and turned Puritans indeed, but God be praiſed they neuer were, nor I hope euer will be perſuaded by him and his workes, if they haue anie branies in their heads. No ſuerlie. And if they come but once to examine this his booke and get a view of the diſcouerie of his deceipts, they will be ſo farre from being moued either by his reaſons or by his authority to relinquish their owne faith, that doubtleſſe they will rather be quite out of loue both with him &amp; his religion. And euen in this particular perſuaſion of his he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth himſelfe ſo ridiculous as no man of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if he marke his proceeding can euer eſteeme him as a man worthy either to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2119:25"/> heard or followed. For what man in the world will be moued by him who in ſteede of proofes bringeth his owne perſuaſions onely of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the conſcience of thoſe whom he houlds for aduerſaries, and whoſe conſciences if he proceedes conſequently, he muſt either hould for bad, or at the leaſt for vnknowne to himſelfe. What is this but <hi>abſurdum per abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius?</hi> and yet he is ſo confident in this his vaine perſuaſion that he cometh to ſpecifie diuerſe points of Popery which he affirmeth to haue beene renounced by many Romaniſts, ſome of which pointes are no Poperie at all, but either his owne lies, or els his ignorant miſtake of the true doctrine of Papiſts in thoſe particulars.</p>
                     <p>For example in his page 32. he demaundeth of vs how many Romaniſts <hi>doe ſmile at fained miracles, at diuine vertue aſcribed to medals, beades, Agnus deis, and the like</hi> which ſaying of his is meerely grounded vpon a falſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or rather a ſlanderous falſitie of his owne coyning, as if it were true that the Romaniſts in generall did both approue falſe miracles, and hould diuine vertue to be in medals, beades, and Agnus deis, neither of which is true or was euer defended by any Romaniſt in the world, it being both true and manifeſtlie knowen that though all Romaniſts hould the foreſaid things for holie, and do aſſure themſelues that God doth ſometimes pleaſe to worke ſtrange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2119:26"/> by them, yet do not they beleeue that any diuine vertue doth reſide in them, no more then they hould to haue reſided in the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of <hi>S. Peter</hi> which neuertheleſſe wrought ſtrange and miraculous effects. So that by this diſcourſe Sir Humfrey doth onelie proue his owne ignorance and malice, as alſo he doth moſt manifeſtlie in the next lines, and that more ſubtillie then before, where he demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>how many (Romaniſts) do preferre the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of Prieſts mariage before the keeping of a concubine; although</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>the contrarie be the common doctrine of the Church of Rome?</hi> In which wordes he doth indeauour craftilie to inſinuate to his reader that it is a poynt of Poperie, and that the Roman Church doth approoue the keeping of a Concubine by a Prieſt rather then he should marrye, whereas the Church doth not in anie caſe allowe eyther of the one or the other; but onelie houldes that, that Prieſt offendeth God more grieuouſlie who marrieth to wit after his preiſthood and vowe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Saecerdos ſi fornicetur aut domi concubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat, tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metſi graui ſacrilegio ſeſe obstin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat: gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiùs tamen peccat ſi contrahat matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium. &amp;c.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2119:27"/> he doth by vertue of the grace of God and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe forſooth, <hi>many for feare of vaine glorie and preſumption, and by reaſon of the vncertainelie of their owne workes at their</hi> death doe relie wholie on the merits of their Sauiour; whereas indeede theſe are two farre different poynts of doctrine, the firſt, that is, the trueth of mans merit in the ſenſe declared being a matter of faith in the Roman Church; the ſecond which is the confidence in merits, being none; the one being about the ſubſtance of merits, the other onelie about the qualitie; the one about the abſolute acknowledgment of merits, the other onely about the ouergreate confidence or preſumption in them: And ſo he that renounceth the firſt, renounceth Poperie indeede, but he that renounceth the ſecond doth not; neither can he be called a Proteſtant as the knight would haue him to be, for the onelie deniall of confidence in merits, as in it ſelfe it is moſt manifeſt.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2119:27"/> inferre that therefore the Bishop renounced the trueth of the doctrine of merits in generall, nay nor his owne merits in particular, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the preſumption of them, or the confidence in them by reaſon of the vncertainetie of them, as I haue alreadie declared. Beſides that, this which he is affirmed to ſay of himſelfe being but onelie a relation of <hi>Fox,</hi> we may iuſtlie doubt of the trueth of it. For he hath bene long ſince hunted to his hole by a learned Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike and his vnright Reuerence manifeſtlie conuinced to be a Father of lyes.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore he is of no credit with vs; neither can his teſtimonie preuaile againſt vs. We care not for him, his acts and monuments are of no moment among vs, his teſtimonie is not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Romaniſt which is that our aduerſary promiſed in the title of his booke, and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he should performe: and to omit the ſmale credit which I and all Catholikes giue to the relations of Maſter Fox, yet I fynde that he who hath dealt ſo falſely with others, hath now founde one of his owne profeſſion who dealt not verie ſincerelie with him in recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of his relation the paſſage of B. Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at his death, for whereas Sir Humfrey will needs proue by the teſtimonie of Fox, that this Bishop renounced Poperie at his death in the pointe of merits: yet Fox in his 2622. page onelie ſaith thus: <hi>That according to the reporte of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2119:28"/> one whome he will not name</hi> (perhaps he could not) <hi>when D. Day Bishop of Chicheſter came to him and began to conforte him</hi> (great comfort I warant you) <hi>with wordes of Gods promiſſe and free iuſtification in the blood of Chriſt our Sauiour repeating the ſcriptures to him. Wincheſter hearing that. What my lord, quoth he, will you open that gap now, then farewell altogether: to mee and ſuch other in my caſe you may ſpeake it, but if you open this window vnto the people then farewell all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now according to this ſpeech of B. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner let the iudicious reader imagin if he can how Sir Humfrey can poſſibly gather that he renowced Poprietie and that a wiſer man will not rather collect the contrarie: to wit that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' dayes wordes might be vttered to him &amp; others of learning and vnderſtanding without danger of peruerſion, but not perhaps to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people who by their ignorance and fray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letie might eaſilie miſinterpret them (as he did that vttered them) and ſo eaſilie receiue harme by them not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that they of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in a founde fenſe include nothing but truth.</p>
                     <p>The knight alſo citeth to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (yet to no purpoſe) <hi>Bellarmine in his ſixte booke of Iuſtif.</hi> 7. <hi>chap. and his testament or laſt will.</hi> Saying in the firſt place that <hi>it is the ſafeſt way to rely wholy on the merits of Christ Ieſus.</hi> But this according to that which hath bene already ſaid of this matter, is at the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2119:28"/> moſt but onelie a renuntiation of preſumption or ouermuch confidence in our owne vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine merits, as is moſt apparent out of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> owne doctrine euen in the verie ſame chapter where the wordes cited by Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey are found thoug much otherwiſe then by him they are related as afterwardes I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Now in the ſecond place, the wordes are theſe. <hi>I beſeech him</hi> (that is God) ſaith Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>that he would admitte me into the companie of his Saints and elect, not as a valluer of merits, but as a giuer of mercie;</hi> which wordes, if the knigth had not bene ouermuch diſtracted, he would eaſilie haue perceiued that they fauour his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent nothing at all, as not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyning any kinde of renuntiation of the due eſtimation of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in themſelues, but onelie ſignifie a certaine negatiue renuntiation of confidence in his owne particular deſerts at the hands of God, which is both moſt conformable to the ſame moſt learned and virtuous Cardinalls owne doctrine in his booke of Iuſtification before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and alſo moſt pious in it ſelfe. But it ſeemes our learned Knigth, was either ignorantlie or malitiouſlie deceiued in the true meaning of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> wordes, imagining verie ſillilie, that becauſe the Cardinall at his death prayed God to receiue him into glorie, not as a valuer of merits, he had held God for no valuer of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits at all, whereas God knowes, the pious
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2119:29"/> Prelate had no ſuch meaning; neither doe his wordes rightlie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrued, carrye anie ſuch ſenſe rather doe expreſſe the contrarie by tearming God a valuer of merits in generall: although on the otherſide conſidering his owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Non aeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mator me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riti ſed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae quaeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Largi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> Can. Miſſ.</note> and the vncertainetie of his owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deſeruinges, out of an humble mynde, he feared to put himſelfe vpon God as vpon an eſteemer of the ſame (which in caſe he had had no merits at all might haue failed him) but rather made choyſe at the houre of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to caſt himſelfe vpon the mercie of God which hee aſſured himſelfe could neuer be wanting to thoſe who duelie relie vpon his goodnes and bountie. And put the caſe a poore diſtreſſed creature should begge an almes of Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey intreating him to take pitty on him, not as a learned man but as a liberall knight, could he therefore iuſtelie ſay the beggar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him to be a learned man? no ſuerlie, and why? marie becauſe the beggar although he knew him well enough to be a learned man, yet he knew alſo it was not his learning that could releeue his neceſſity, but his money. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner it happeneth in the caſe we treate of: for as ſuch a begger could not trulie be ſaid to haue renounced the knights learning in that caſe, ſo neither could Cardinall Bell: be iuſtlie ſuppoſed to renounce God as a valuer of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the ſtate he was in by recurring vnto
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2119:29"/> him onely as to a beſtower of mercie. And thus we ſee that Bell: dyed as greate a Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike as he liued, notwithſtanding all Sir Humfrey can ſay againſt him he can no ſooner make Bellarmin a Proteſtant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he can make a Proteſtant of the Canon of the Maſſe it ſelfe which hath the verie ſame wordes which the Card. Piouſly, vſed at the houre of his death. Next after <hi>Bellarmine</hi> Sir Humfrey hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Albertus Phigius,</hi> who if we will credit him, telleth vs <hi>he became a Caluiniſt euen in this verie poynt by reading of Caluins inſtitutions.</hi> Thus he relateth this ſtorie and will haue vs take it on the worde of a knight, but he muſt pardon vs Romane Catholikes if we refuſe to beleeue it vpon the bare relation of an aduerſarie, as houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our ſelues to haue full as greate authoritie at the leaſt, to denie it as he hath to affirme it. True it is he quoteth a place of the authour in the margin, but citeth not a worde of his in the text, as in the like occaſion he vſeth to doe, which cauſeth me to perſuade my ſelfe there is no ſuch matter to be founde, or at leaſt ſome miſtake in Sir Humfrey in the true meaning of his wordes, as he miſtooke in Bellarmine. Eſpeciallie conſidering that Pighius is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſlie knowen to haue bene a profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie both to Luther and Caluin as his workes doe teſtifie. And that Pighius differeth both from the Lutherans &amp; Caluiniſts in the maine
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2119:30"/> paint. Of iuſtification it is moſt manifeſt by his whole diſcourſe, and particularlie in that he abſolutelie affirmes in his 53. page of his Controuerſie of iuſtification, that faith alone though it be neuer ſo perfect is not ſufficient to iuſtification, ſaying: <hi>Sed fidem hanc ſolam non ſufficere nobis &amp;c.</hi> in which place although he doth not name or mention Caluin, yet doth he expreſſelie and profeſſedlie diſpute againſt that doctrine of his and Luther which putteth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification in faith onelie, ſo that it hence plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie appeareth that if Pighius did read Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins Inſtitutions as Sir Humfrey affirmeth, it was not to follow them but to confute them. He quoteth alſo <hi>Ruardus Tapperus</hi> to what purpoſe I know not except it be to fill his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for oſtentation, and ſo I leaue it till he shall further pleaſe to declare his meaning, touching that citation which may be he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for a fourth edition: in the interim that <hi>Taperus</hi> was a profeſſed papiſt his bookes do witnes. And now hauing made it plainelie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere that not one of the Romaniſts which the knight citeth in this ſection euer renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced anie point of Poperie before his death, or at the leaſt that no one, nor all the teſtimonies which he produceth out of Romaniſts doe proue anie ſuch renunciation, as he auerreth: and alſo that ſome of thoſe which he alledgeth for proofe of his aſſertion, as true Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2119:30"/> were not as much as in externall showe of the Catholike religion long before their death, and ſome of them in no parte of their whole life as is manifeſt in <hi>Iewell, Fox,</hi> and <hi>Cooke,</hi> and conſequentlie could not in reaſon be produced by him as witneſſes in fauour of his cauſe noe more then <hi>Martin Luther</hi> or <hi>Iohn Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> this I ſay ſuppoſed, it onelie now remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that for the concluſion of this Period we doe not onelie cenſure the Contents of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for vnſounde doctrine, but alſo the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of it for an indirect and falſe dealer in the confirmation of the ſeame.</p>

                     <p>THE fift ſection of the booke is about the impediments of reformation of ſuch thinges as the knight iudgeth inexcuſable in themſelues: and for impediments of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he aſſigneth wordlie pollicie and profitte, the thinges which he calleth inexcuſable are the doctrine of Purgatorie, Indulgences, prayer for the dead, the communion vnder one kinde, worship of pictures, and ſuch other poynts of Catholike doctrine all which hee temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie affirmeth to be inexcuſable and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by waye of an odious relation of then in particular, but adduceth nothing whereby to proue anie one of them to be ſuch indeede, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2119:31"/> ſo neither will I proue anie thing againſt him heere more then that he vttereth diuerſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes in this one ſection. Firſt in that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth <hi>the faith of Purgatorie is confirmed by Councells meerelie for the benefit of the Pope and his Clergie,</hi> which is nothing els but a manifeſt calumniation without all apparance of trueth, it being a thing wholie improbable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to common ſenſe, either that ſo manie learned, graue and pious men as vſe to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Councells should determine anie thing as matter of faith meerelie for anie Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall reſpect whatſoeuer: or that the laitie of the Chriſtian world, eſpeciallie Princes, Kinges and Emperours being ſo much more powerfull as they are knowen to bee, then the Pope and Clergie, should condeſcend to a matter of ſuch indignitie as the knight would haue it and ſo much to their coſt, if they did not otherwiſe aſſure themſelues both of the integrity of thoſe who meete in thoſe aſſemblies, and alſo of the trueth of the doctrine in it ſelfe. Beſides that the ſame is manifeſtlie conuinced of falſitie, for that prayer for the deade, and conſequentlie Purgatorie, was knowen in the world before eyther Pope, or Councells were extant as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the hiſtorie of the ſecond booke of the <hi>Macchabies</hi> the 12. chapter which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries themſelues cannot denie to be a true hiſtorie, though they impudentlie denie it to

                     <p>His ſecond vntruth it in the end of the 39. page, where he affirmeth, that the Romaniſts in the pſalters leaue out the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. This ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vntruth of the knight inuolueth a double vntruth, the firſt is in that he ſaith the Romaniſts leaue out the foreſaid commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in their pſalters, whereas it is well knowne that in the whole <hi>Pſalter</hi> the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, at the leaſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally as it is one of the ten. But this vntruth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I perceiue it proceedes rather of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> malice, I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to pardon. Yet becauſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2119:32"/> when he ſaid the Romaniſts lefte it out of their pſalters, he either meant they lefte it out of the text of Scripture, or that they left it out of their catechiſmes onely, I a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer that whetherſoeuer he meant, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be excuſed for telling an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, firſt becauſe he falſely ſuppoſeth for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that to be the ſecond commaundement which indeede is but an explication of the firſt, in the opinion both of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> and either all or almoſt all other diuines of later yeares. Secondly becauſe thoſe ſame authours: who hould thoſe ſame wordes. <hi>Thou shalt not make to this ſelfe any grauen image,</hi> to be the ſecond commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, doe not hould that the Images of Chriſt and his ſaints, and due honour of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are prohibited by that precept among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but onely a gentilicall or idolatrous vſe of pictures or grauen images of falſe Gods and other ſuch abuſes as be repugnant to the due honour of the true and onely God. Laſtly it is alſo falſe that all Catechiſmes leaue out that precept, if precept it be, as appeareth by the Catechiſme of the Councell of Trent and of <hi>Caniſius</hi> and ſome others. So that you ſee now that the knight is euery way conuinced of an vntruth. And although it is true that in diuerſe of their Catechiſmes the Romaniſts leaue out all the reſt of the firſt commaundement as they lie in the text of the 20. of <hi>Exodus</hi> excepting thoſe: <hi>Thou shall haue no other Gods but me.</hi> Yet
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2119:32"/> they doe not ſo with any ſiniſter intention, as the reformers vniunſtly accuſe them to doe, in regard, it is well knowne that thoſe who vſe to inſtruct children in their Catechiſme notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they vſe not to fill childrens heads with ſuch proclamations againſt graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Images as the reformers doe, yet they neuer omitte to declare and explicate exactly the whole tenour of the words of the commaundement, inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting moſt diligently the true ſenſe of the ſame and teaching them how farre it is true that images and the worshippe of them in prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that precept, &amp; the difference betweene the vſe of Chriſtian images and thoſe which according to the practice of thoſe times were vnlawfull. But the true reaſon why Romaniſts moſt commonly omitte thoſe wordes: <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen thing,</hi> and the reſt, is becauſe Catechiſmes being onely a short ſumme of Religion, it is fitting they be moſt briefe and compendious as being ſo more eaſy to learne and more conformable to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of children, then if they were large and prolixe in wordes, eſpecially conſidering that that which wanteth in wordes may farre more eaſily be added by the maſter by may of cxpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation then many lines can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory by weake, and vnapt ſchollers. Neither doe the Romaniſts make catechiſmes for Iewes and Gentiles but for Chriſtians and Catholiks
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2119:33"/> and ſo it were both ſuperfluous and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to put in all the wordes of the text or more as the reformers doe, ſome of which doe belong rather to the law of <hi>moyſes</hi> then to the Ghoſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and therefore for the verie ſame reaſon the Romaniſts leaue out of their Catechiſmes diuerſe words of the precept of the Sabaoth, as iudging them vnneceſſarie for the inſtruction of Chriſtian children. As alſo becauſe according to the doctrine of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> in his queſtion vpon this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe onely words: <note place="margin">Vide illum infra in fine op.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou shalt haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods but me:</hi> are the whole ſubſtance of the firſt commaundement, and the ſame in ſenſe with the other which immediatly follow in the text, to wit, <hi>thou shalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen thing,</hi> by which <hi>grauen thing</hi> S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin in the ſame place vnderſtandeth an <hi>idol</hi> &amp; not any grauen image as the reformers doe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptedly vſe to tranſlate and commonly put it ſo in their Catechiſmes for the falſe inſtruction of their children. And hence it plainely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the Romaniſts leaue not out of any of their bookes of Chriſtian doctrine anie of the ten commandements, but rather that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed brothers put in one more then either according to Scripture or the doctrine of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> they ought to doe, as by the true diuiſion and number of them at the end of this worke shall the be more manifeſtly declared.</p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:2119:33"/>
                     <p>Thirdly it is vntrue which he affirmeth, though by way of inſinuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely, that the Romaniſts <hi>doe adore a piece of bread.</hi> For it is well knowne they adore not the bread but that which chriſt, himſelfe affirmed to be his body, for which adoration beſides the ſcripture, we ſay with S. Auguſtin: <hi>nemo illam carnem manducat niſi prius adorauerit.</hi> Aug. in pſ. 98. and ſo this, though Sir Humfrey as it ſeemes was ashamed to vtter it plainely, yet it is no leſſe then a plaine leaſing. Beſides theſe vntrueths which I haue now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed he hath diuerſe very idle poſitions ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe or friuolous, as for example <hi>that the power of binding and looſing depends vpon Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that by defect of the Prieſts intention the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper of the bodie of Christ in the Sacrament may commit flat Idolatry</hi> and the like, theſe becauſe they are left by him vnproued, I will alſo leaue them vnrefuted till ſuch time as I shall ſee his proofes produced, and in the meane time I condemne this whole ſection, as containing matter both idle, falſe, calumnious, and full of inuectiue bitterneſſe and puritannicall ſpleene againſt the Romaniſts accuſing them that they <hi>turne the necks of Scriptures cleane about; &amp; that it is a common practice of their Church of Rome to make greater price of victory then verity,</hi> &amp; other ſuch matter as is vnworthy to be published ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by printe or pen.</p>

                     <p>THE knight in his ſixt ſection promiſeth to refute that which he tearmeth the Common practice of his aduerſaries in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall of reformation, becauſe ſaith he, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſigne the preciſe time when errours came in. This I confeſſe is a matter of importance, and if Sir Humfrey can performe his promiſe he will in parte recouer the credit which he hath formerly loſt; if not, his honour muſt ſtill lye in the duſt. Now to performe his promiſe he muſt know that it is not ſufficient for him &amp; his partners to aſſigne the time and perſons when and by whom thoſe points of doctrine, which they hould to be erroneouſly maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Roman Church, were firſt broached, but they muſt alſo by ſome meanes or other conuince them to be errours indeede. And as long as Sr Humfrey failes in the demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of either of theſe, it is manifeſt he doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his worde. He ſaith indeede very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in the beginning of this ſection, that they (meaning as I ſuppoſe himſelfe and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in ſect) are all eye-witneſſes that the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church are this daye ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious that a very child may perceaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but what is this to the purpoſe? this is but a friuolous repetition of their owne bare wordes, this is no
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2119:34"/> lawfull proofe among aduerſaries, this is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, it is not this Romane Catholiks are bound to ſtand too, this is no reaſonable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for vs or any other be he neuer ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. We muſt be conuinced of errours by Scriptures, by conſent of auncient Fathers, by plaine definitions of approoued Councels. And till you Sir Humfrey, or ſome of your conſorts make this point cleare, we acknowledge no errours in our Church, and by conſequence no neceſſity of reformation in that nature, as your diſcourſe in this ſection doth falſely ſuppoſe. Moreouer touching the aſſignation of time &amp; perſons, when and by whom the pretended er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Roman Church had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is apparant the knight is in a great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, in that he perſuadeth himſelfe that the Romaniſts exact of the reformers to aſſigne the time and perſons when and by whom ſuch errours as they attribut to their Church were firſt broached: For the Romaniſts do not ſtand preciſely vpon aſſignation of the very firſt time and perſons, or the very firſt Authours of thoſe ſuppoſed errours, no they put no ſuch rigorous taske vpon the reformers, but onely oblige them to shewe when they were firſt ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and apparent in the world, as both they &amp; their authours were condemned in any authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Councell or aſſembly, and this is that onely which the Catholikes demaund of their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2119:35"/> aduerſaries, and not that which Sir Humfrey imagineth; and therefore whatſoeuer he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth in this ſection for the confirmation of his intent in that particular, proceedeth vpon falſe ſuppoſition, and conſequently proueth nothing but his owne ignorance. That which is a thing not onely proper to Sir Humfrey in diuerſe places of his booke, but alſo ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incident to the reſt of his conreformers as in reading their workes I haue often lamented their caſe to ſee them ſo labour in vaine like hounds ſpending vpon a falſe ſent. And ſurely nothing els but the foreſaid falſe ſuppoſition was the cauſe why Sir Humfrey proceeded in this point in ſo farre a different manner as he doth from the reſt of his fellowes. He not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon him as they ordinarily doe (tho' without effect) to aſſigne the time when thoſe imagined errours firſt began, and who were the firſt authours of the ſame; but as it were ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that to be impoſſible, or els aduerticeing the ill ſucceſſe which his fellow ſectaries haue had in proſectuing their waye, fell vpon a quite contrary courſe, indeauouring to shewe a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and difference betwixt the hereſies of the <hi>Arians, Pelagians, and Donatiſts,</hi> and the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which he ſuppoſeth to be in the Roman Church: graunting that thoſe hereſies being ſuch as did (ſaith he) indaunger the foundation and openly diſturbed the Church, might eaſely
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2119:35"/> be diſcouered, adding that their firſt authours de facto were obſerued and the times knowne &amp; place pointed at. But the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts doctrine, ſaith he, was a ſecret Apoſtaſie ſcarcely to be knowne or diſcouered, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo that for an impertinent demaunde which the Catholikes vſually require of the reformers, to wit, that they shewe the firſt time and produce the firſt authours of the ſuppoſed Romish errours; by this shewing himſelfe very deſirous to rid his handes of ſo hard a taske as he hath vndertaken, as doth plainely appeare by thoſe examples and ſimilitudes which he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for that purpoſe tho' not very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. And now this being the ſenſe of the firſt parte of this ſection, let vs briefely examine how ſoundly he proueth his intent. <note place="margin">Matth. 13.24.</note> In the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the ſower (ſaith he) Chriſt himſelfe giues a full anſwer to thoſe impertinent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaunds, he telleth vs that after the good ſeede was ſowen, the enemy ſowed tares when men were a ſleepe. Thus he anſwereth to the impertinent queſtion of the Romaniſte as he tearmeth it. But good Sir Humfrey if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be impertinent why doe you anſwer to it? why doe not you rather paſſe it with ſilence then ſpend your breath about it? but it ſeemes you will needes anſwer, yea and father your anſwer vpon our Sauiour as if Chriſt himſelfe had anſwered in the words cited to the ſame
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2119:36"/> queſtion which you ſay the Romaniſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of you. Fy what application of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is this! are you a maſter in Iſraell and yet ignorant that our Sauiour vſed that Parable to another purpoſe? did not our Sauiour meane by the enemy, the Deuill, by the tares vices, and by the field the ſoule of man? is not this a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expoſition of interpreters? or if you will needes haue it vnderſtood of errours in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and of the ſower of them in the field of the Church, of which we know there are good ſtore in your congregation, yet can the parable of our Sauiour auayle your purpoſe nothing at all. For that the queſtion of the parable is generall and ſo a generall anſwer was ſufficient. But the demaund of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes is particular &amp; ſo in reaſon it requiers an anſwer in particular; for example, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is if Purgatorie be an errour of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, who was the firſt authour of it? In what age did he liue? if not to communicate in both kindes be an errour of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, who was the firſt authour of it? &amp;c. So that in the queſtion of the Romaniſts there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencie in the ſenſe in which they demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, but the knight's anſwer is both impertinent in it ſelfe and alſo falſely fathered vpon our Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>True it is that the Roman Catholiks, as I haue ſaid before, doe not oblige the knight
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2119:36"/> nor anie of his conſorts to anſwer ſo metaphiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to their demaund as he erroneouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadeth himſelfe. But they onely vrge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers to name the authours and time of ſuch ſuppoſed errours in a morall manner; that is who they were that haue beene in anie lawfull Councell condemned for either the broachers or publike defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dours of thoſe he calles errours. Which is a demaunde ſo farre from imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, that there hath neuer beene any noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious errour in the Church of God which hath not beene noted ſo by the writers of the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ages wherein they liued, or at the leaſt, by ſome others preſentlie after their time. And ſo hence it appeareth manifeſtlie, that the Roman Catholikes being no wiſe guiltie of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie in their demaund, yet Sir Humfrey is moſt impertinent in his anſwer, and not onelie an impertinent alledger of Scriptures, but alſo a peruerſe detorter of the ſame, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting them by the direction of his owne priuate ſpirit, and fathering vpon Chriſt that which he neuer thought nor intended. And this being the ſubſtance of his anſwer to the Catholikes, which in trueth hath no ſubſtance in it: yet he ſtill proſecuteth the ſame making a greate flourish out of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the ſame parable adding that the tares were ſowen by the enemie when men where a fleepe, and that by conſequence they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2119:37"/> could not ſee him and much leſſe produce him. I confeſſe that there both haue bene and be yet in the world who by reaſon of the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue moiſture of their braiue haue ſleeped both verie ſoundlie and verie long. I know the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of the ſeauen ſleepers who ſlept ſome hundreths of yeares. But I neuer heard of anie kinde of Congregation of people that all and euerie one of them ſleeped about a thouſand yeares together and that ſo profundelie as that not one of them did euer ſo much as once dreame of the enimie who ſowed tares in their field. Is it poſſible that all the good men of the houſes in all that ſpace of tyme and in euerie place should haue bene ſo drowſie and ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ſleepe as none of them could not one tyme or other awake &amp; catch the theefe before the daies of Luther. Surelie there was neuer a Puritane in the world in all that long ſpace of tyme, for if there had bene anie, ſome of them would infalliblie haue awaked, their hott brauies and fierie ſpirits would neuer haue ſuffered them to lie ſo long in a lethargie, but vp they would haue beene and layd about them moſt vallantlie with the whole bulke of the Bible, and haue gone to cuffes with Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Purgatorie and prayer to Saints, with pictures, Pope and praier for the dead, with merits, maſſe, and monaſteries, with confeſſion, tradition, and tranſubſtantiation, with Indults,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2119:37"/> faſts, and ſatisfactions. Theſe I ſay and all other ſuch like tares as the knight eſteemes them, had bene by thoſe Zealous Paterfamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians rooted out as ſoone as euer they peeped out of the earth, if God had not permitted them to take a greate quantitie of Diapodium or pouder dormant by force of which, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they were all ſo lulled a ſleepe as not one of them could once awake till the tyme of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour Luther, who if he had chaunced to haue taken one onelie dramme of the ſame receipt, it is more then probable that greate worke of his had laine vndone till this preſent day, and perhaps for euer. From this parable Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey paſſeth to confirme his anſwer by reaſons, ſaying that the doctrine which they complaine of his a myſterie of iniquitie, and myſteries are ſecret and worke not openlie and publikly but by degrees, leaſurelie, cunninglie and warilie to auoyde diſcoueries. Thus he, in which wordes you ſee he cals errours a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but deſcribes them rather like a monſter then a myſterie, attributing ſuch ſubtiltie vnto them as if they had the vſe of reaſon; whereas all errours which are ſuch trulie, are by nature voyd of reaſon, and ſo, no myſteries but rather monſters. Hee ſaith they are ſecret and worke by decrees: And it is true, errours may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for a short tyme, but long they cannot, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie ſuch as we heere ſpeake of, that is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliklie
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2119:38"/> defended by a whole Church and all or moſt of them manie ages together. Mentall and priuate errours may be ſo ſmothered as not onelie not by degrees, but ſo as they neuer come to light and knowledge of the world at all, but vocall errours propoſed and published to the people cannot poſſible be long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne or vndiſcouered. Witnes the errours of Luther and Caluin and of all other condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heretikes, all which doubtleſſe for a tyme they were, meerelie mentall, yet euen before the death of their authours notice was taken of them, &amp; perhaps alſo they were publikelie condemned. And ſo we ſee by this reaſon Sir Humfrey proueth nothing to this purpoſe, but tels vs of nothing but meere impoſſibillities contrarie both to reaſon and common ſenſe. Neither doth it auaile him for defence of his anſwer to ſaye that errours being at firſt often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in one or few perſons onelie, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſilie be eſpied, for this is not that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes vrge him too, we haue tould him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie that wee will not deale ſo rigorouſlie with him, we are content to graunt vnto him that errours onelie ſo farre published, were not eaſilie, eſpeciallie by his drowſie conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, to be diſcouered: neuertheleſſe we ſee no reaſon at all why our ſuppoſed errours being ſo publiquelie taught, penned, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as they were long before either Luther or
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2119:38"/> Wicklifs tyme should not haue bene knowen for errours if ſuch they were, long before ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their daies, This is the point of the queſtion, this is the demaunde the Roman Catholikes vrge, you Reformers are to anſwer, as longe as you goe about the bush as you doe, and anſwer not directlie, neither your Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall parable nor your cockatrice egge, though you write it with a greate letter to make it ſeeme bigger, will ſerue your turne, they are but onelie ſimilitudes or examples ill applied, they prooue nothing but onelie ſerue you for a vaine flourish. <hi>Exempla illuſtrant non probant,</hi> eſpeciallie if they be equiuocall as yours be. And as for your diſtinction of publike hereſie and ſecret Apoſtacie, it is much more friuolous then all the reſt you haue brought for the proofe of your purpoſe in this ſection. And although perhaps you shewed no ſmall ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it, as you thought, yet is it in it ſelfe a moſt ignorant piece of doctrine, for that not onelie the common and vſuall ſenſe of the worde <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> but the verie etimologie of the ſame worde, which ſignifieth a defection or diſceſſion, doth demonſtrate that the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by it muſt be a much more externall and publike action in it ſelfe then hereſie vſed to be, and ſo that which is ordinarilie and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garilie called <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> muſt be publike and not ſecret; and therefore when anie errour
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2119:39"/> comes to that degree of malice as it may truely be called Apoſtaſie in this ſenſe, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie be knowne, and conſequentlie it is ſuch as cannot be kept ſecret but may be moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie diſcerned, yea much more eaſilie then anie hereſie how publike ſoeuer it bee, as being an aggrauating circunſtance of the ſame. And thus we ſee that for the knight to yeeld a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the errours of the Roman Church could not eaſilie be diſcouered, becauſe they were ſecret Apoſtaſie, is both moſt abſurd in itſelfe, and alſo inuolueth a contradiction in regard it includeth that a thing may be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie that is a thing of it owne ſelfe publike, and yet remaine ſo ſecret that it cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered. Neither is that which Sir Humfrey farther addeth in the ſame place leſſe abſurde to witt that <hi>ſecret Apoſtaſie worketh warelie and cloſelie in the tyme of Darkenes when the ſeruants of the huſbandman are aſleepe,</hi> for if all Apoſtaſie as it is commonlie taken, muſt be publike, as I haue showed, how can it then truelie be ſaid to worke in darkenes or by night? or how can the ſeede of it be ſcattered at vnawares to the ſeruants of the husbandman, certainlie except the ſeruants be ſo ſluggish that they ſleepe both nights and dayes, moneths and yeeres, yea and manie hundreth of yeeres together, naye and all the daies of their life, they cannot but diſcouer the tares of Apoſtaſie, which is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2119:39"/> not euer in ſeede as the knight falſelie ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, but is the increaſe or rather full growth it ſelfe, or yet rather the ouergrouth of the crop of hereſie which is truelie the ſeede of it.</p>
                     <p>From hence the knight proceedeth to the ſecond parte of his ſection, in which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to shewe vs an <hi>vndeniable trueth</hi> (as he termeth it) <hi>that ſome opinions were condemned in the Primatiue Church for eroneous and ſupersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious vhich now are eſtablished for articles oſ faith in the Roman Church.</hi> And for this his poſition he produceth an inſtance out of S. Auguſtin lib. de moribus Eccleſ. Cath. cap. 34. in which place he complaines that in his tyme the ruder ſort of people were intangled with ſuperſtition euen in the true Church; <hi>I my ſelfe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>know manie that are worshipers of Images and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers whom the Church condemneth and ſeeketh euerie daie by correction to amend them as vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious children:</hi> Thus farre Sir Humfrey out of S. Auguſtin. To which I anſwer that this place of S. Auguſtin hath bene ſo often obiected by the moderne ſectaries that it is worne quite thred bare with handling, and I perſuade my ſelfe that all the Catholike authours that euer writt of controuerſies haue ſufficientlie anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered it if it came in their way. Neuertheleſſe leaſt Sir Humfrey should thinke himſelfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected by me, <note place="margin">Nolite conſectari turbas imperito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum qui vel in ipſa vera reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi ſunt, vel ita libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti vt obliti ſint quicquid promiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint Deo. Aug. ſupra.</note> I anſwer firſt that S. Auguſtin complaineth in this place of certaine gentilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2119:40"/> errours and abuſes in the adoration of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ſepulchers then practiſed in the true Church by ſome priuate ignorant and vitious perſons, who without diſtinction either of the one or the other did worship the tombes and pictures of all ſortes of people. Secondlie I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer that S. Auguſtin in the place cited, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of anie generall doctrine taught in his tyme touching the adoration of pictures, but onelie of ſome ſuperſtitious abuſes in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the ſame, and ſo alſo in this reſpect the obiection is impertinent. I anſwer thirdlie that ſuppoſe there were ſome particular perſons in the tyme of S. Auguſtine guiltye either in the manner of their worship of pictures or in their doctrine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the lawfullnes of the ſame, doth it thence therefore follow that Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes are guiltie alſo of the ſame crime? or is it conſequent, that that honour which Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes graunte to the pictures of Chriſt and his Saincts, is iuſt the ſame with that which Saint Auguſtine mentioneth? No ſuerlie. For as there may be abuſe committed in the due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of pictures, ſo there may be alſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe in the due adoreing of them, and ſo it is cleere that it is no true manner of argument or true conſequence to collect ſo. Thoſe people whom S. Auguſtin reprehended for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring of pictures in his tyme did worship ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges reprehenſiblie: But the Romaniſts doe alſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2119:40"/> worship images, therefore the Romaniſts doe worship images reprehenſiblie. This I ſay were it in anie figure, yet is it a captious forme of argument containing a manifeſt fallacie or equiuocation in the <hi>minor</hi> by reaſon of which the Sylogiſme concludeth nothing.</p>
                     <p>Now vpon the foreſaid wordes of Saint Auguſtin, Sir Humfrey addeth a deſcant of his owne, in which he comits diuerſe faults. Firſt in that he ſaith that although S. Aug. did note ſome people of his time for ſuperſtitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of images, yet did hee neither name the authours of that errour, nor sheweth the tyme when it began tacitlie, intending hence to infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that neither are the reformers bounde to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne the names of the authours of thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which they attribute to the Roman Church, nor yet the tyme of their defence of them. But this inference of the knight is no concluſion at all, for that the caſe of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines tyme which is the antecedent of the foreſaid illation of the knights, is farre different from the caſe of the reformers as well for that S. Auguſtine ſpeaketh of an errour which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in his owne daies (as Sir Humfrey con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth) and perhappes by ſuch perſons as he could not name without preiudice of their fame, as being ſuch as practiſed thoſe ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo priuatelie that they were not knowen to more, or at the leaſt, not to manie more then
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2119:41"/> himſelfe; after which manner preachers do vſe to reprehend vices of perſons knowen vnto them, and yet name them not: as alſo and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felie becauſe S. Auguſtine was neuer demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them in particular, or anie other waye vrged to declare their names. None of all which circumſtances occurre in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Reformers and the Romaniſts, and ſo out of the wordes of S. Auguſtine, which be the Antecedent of the knights argument, no true conſequence can be deduced againſt the Romaniſts.</p>
                     <p>

But this is all falſe, and grounded onelie vpon an erroneous perſuaſion of his owne, videlicet, that the worship which thoſe people of which S. Auguſtin ſpeaketh, gaue to pictures, is the ſame which the Roman Church practizeth at this daye according to the definition of thoſe two Councells; that which he neither proueth heere, nor can euer proue in anie other place, as being manifeſt by the doctrine of thoſe ſame Councells in this point, that they both condemned this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious practice of thoſe people reprehended
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2119:41"/> by S. Auguſtin &amp; the Church of his age, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much as he did in thoſe former tymes. And ſo neither this inſtance framed by Sir Humfrey out of S. Auguſtins wordes, nor the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it ſelfe concludes any part of his intent in this ſection: but rather conuinceth by the fact of the ſame S. Auguſtin that no errour can poſſible ſo ſecretlie ſteale into the Church, but it is either preſently or within a ſmall tyme eſpied and noted for ſuch by one authenticall authour or other; which is quite contrary to the poſition which the knight indeauoureth heere to eſtablish and whoely conformable to the tenet of the Roman Church in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>After this Sir Hum. maketh a large repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diuerſe points of doctrine defended by the Church of Rome, as if they were farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the intention of thoſe who firſt taught or ordeined them, but for this his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt he bringeth no proofe at all, and ſo I leaue it as a voluntary <hi>tenet</hi> founded vpon his owne ſmall authority. True it is he produceth diuerſe authours for the confirmation of the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them all for Romaniſts, and yet ſome of them are not ſo eſteemed to be, as is manifeſt in <hi>Caſſander, and Agrippa,</hi> which the Roman Church houlds not for her true children but rather for illegitimate. Be citeth alſo <hi>Ioannes Ferus</hi> who altho' he was at the leſt once a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2119:42"/> Romaniſt, whatſoeuer he was afterwardes, yet there haue beene noted in his workes diuerſe ill ſounding propoſitions, whether it be for that his bookes haue beene corrupted by the ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of theſe times as by ſome editions of his workes may be iuſtly ſuſpected, or whether it be that the man was ſomething more rash in his aſſertions then he ought to haue beene. But howſoeuer it falleth out with him in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet the place cited out of him by Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey if it be rightly vnderſtood, it proueth no more but that by the priuate abuſes and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ſome particular men, many things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined by holy men with a good intention, haue receiued ſome accidentall chaunge. And although Ferus exemplifieth in the feaſts of the Church, Ceremonies, images, Maſſes, mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, yet certaine it is his meaning was not that all theſe are either vnlawfull or ſuperſtitious, or that they are new articles of faith or not to be vſed in the Church of God, as the knight and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be, but onely out of a pious zeale he wished that ſuch abuſes might be corrected as he perceiued in his daies to haue crept into the practice and vſe of the ſame; which is a thing ſo farre from Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys purpoſe of prouing an alteration in the Doctrine of auncient tymes, as it is both very conformable to reaſon, and allſo to the decree of reformation made in the Councell of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2119:42"/> Trent aboue cited. He citeth allſo <hi>Marius de ſchiſ. &amp; Concil. Et Polidore de inuent. rerum,</hi> as ſpeaking of the vncertainty of the entrance into the Church of Prieſts mariage. But this is nothing to the purpoſe the knight heere trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. For how I pray you doth this proue that there are errours of faith in the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, whereas the reſtraint of mariage of Prieſts it ſelfe, is no article of faith as Sir Humfrey igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly ſuppoſeth, but onely a precept of the Church and a matter of manners; and yet in caſe it were ſo in it ſelfe, neuertheleſſe certaine it is that the queſtion or difficultie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the firſt begining of the reſtraint (of ſuch onelie the cited authours ſpeake) is no matter of faith and conſequentlie can be no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour euen in Sir Humfreyes owne falſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of errours in the Roman Church. To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte that ſuppoſe the firſt begining of the reſtrainte of marriage in Prieſts were truelie an article of faith in the Roman Church, yet this being but one particular inſtance or example drawne out of two Romaniſts onelie, it cannot ſufficientlie proue that generall poſition of Sir Humfrey, to witte, that there was a knowne tyme when thoſe <hi>tenets</hi> (meaning the points of doctrine which the Councell of Trent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined) were not certainelie knowne or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie receiued by the Roman Church; ſince that, according to the rules of Logike no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:2119:44"/> propoſition can be inferred out of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that touching the reſt of the articles of the Roman doctrine, the reformers are ſo farre from the aſſignation of the time of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that Sir Humfrey him ſelfe euen in this verie place is forced to hould this preciſe tyme of the beginning of the ſame to be vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to be aſſigned. And altho' by reaſon that both thoſe authours are ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſured in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorie Index, we are not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit vnto them: yet this I ſaye that ſuppoſing they are both here produced to teſtifie that the beginning of the and prohibition of Preiſts mariage can not be aſſigned, it is rather a great argument that it was appointed by the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church itſelfe then introduced of later yeares. Beſides this Sir Humfrey doth falſifie Polydor in the place he citeth, for he doth not affirme that mariage of Preiſts was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether prohibited til the tyme of Gregorie the 7. but that it could not be taken away till that tyme. <hi>Alijs ſnper alijs promulgatis legibus non ante Pontificatum Gregorij</hi> 7. <hi>coniugium adimi occidentalibus ſacerdotibus potuit.

                     <p>To the like purpoſe or rather to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he citeth alſo <hi>Gregory de Valentia</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that it doth not appeere when the communion in one kinde beganne,</hi> which ſaying of <hi>Valentia</hi> is moſt true, &amp; his meaning is that the cuſtome of communicating ſo, is ſo auncient that it hath no knowne beginning, and conſequentlie it hath bene euer in the Church of God ſince the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and by them practized. And therefore <hi>Valentia</hi> addeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fentlie after to that purpoſe, <hi>that euer from the beginning of the Church ther hath beene ſome vſe of the Euchariſt vnder one kinde,</hi> as he hath showed before. Which wordes as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keing plainelie againſt him he was content to omit. So that this teſtimonie either proueth nothing to the knights purpoſe, or els more then he deſires, as alſo want of honeſt dealing in the citation of it. To omitte that when that manner of communion firſt began in the Church is no article of the Roman faith. The ſame authour is alſo once againe cited by Sir
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2119:45"/> Humfrey for that in the ſame place he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the foreſaid manner of communion <hi>not to haue bene generallie receiued but a little before the councell of Conſtance,</hi> which is no more to the purpoſe then the other allegation or ſcarſe ſo much. For this and ſome other teſtimonies which he citeth page 60. at the moſt doe but onelie proue that ſome of the points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or rather of practice onelie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, were not declaredlie knowen and definede ſucceſſiuelie in all differences of times ſince the eſtablishment of the Goſpell; which the Romaniſts do not denie: though they knowe it is a point impertinent to the matter heere in queſtion, which is not whether the Reformers can showe a time when the tenets (at he termes them) of the Roman Church were not certainelie knowne or generallie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but alſo &amp; cheefely whether they were erroneous; and then if ſuch they were, when they were firſt publikelie knowen and by what authenticall Councell they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Which points becauſe Sir Humfrey hath proued neither of them, neither by the teſtimonies of the authours he cites nor by any other forceable proofe, he hath failed of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and promiſe, and no way recouered the reputation in this ſection which he loſt in the former, but rather hath much increaſed his diſcredit, and conſequentlie the cenſure falleth

                     <p>He endeauoureth to proue the Roman faith to deſcend from auncient heretikes, firſt becauſe they teach prayer in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne language not to be vnlawfull, (as ſaith hee) Epiphanius affirmeth of the heretikes <hi>Oſſeni</hi> in the firſt age. But to this I anſwer that <hi>S.

All which is farre different from the doctrine and practice of the Roman Church in this point, which neither in ſenſe nor wordes vſeth anie other prayers then ſuch as are conformable to that originall prayer which Chriſt him ſelfe appointed his diſciples to vſe. Neither can Epiphanius with anie showe of probabillitie be thought to haue condemned them for heretikes for that which he knew neither to be contrarie to Gods worde, nor anie definition of the auncient Church, either before or in his time. And as for that which the Reformers commonlie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2119:47"/> out of the fourth to the Corinthians and firſt epiſtle. I ſay that if the ſame Epiphanius had vnderſtood it as written againſt ſuch like prayers, infalliblie he would haue alledged the place againſt thoſe heretikes. But he well knew that the Apoſtles meaning was not to condemne prayer in what language ſoeuer it were, but onelie to preferre propheſie before ſtraunge tonges, or at the moſt to preferre prayer in a knowne tonge onelie as more edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatiue, not as abſolutelie neceſſarie, and the contrarie to be condemned as vnlawfull or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, as the noueliſts will needes haue it.</p>
                     <p>And as for precept of the Church the ſame Epiphanius in like manner knew there was none extant. True it is, in his time the practiſe of the Greck Church was to haue their prayer in Greeke and the Latin Church in Latin, but as then neither all thoſe of the Latin Church did vnderſtand that kinde of Latin which then was vſed in the Church, ſo neither all thoſe of the Greeke which was vſed in the publike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Grecians doe (excepting Schollers) as I haue beene truelie informed, by one of that nation; which practiſe as you ſee, is nothing contrary to the practiſe of the preſent Roman Church but rather agreable vnto it. In regard that tho' the Latin Maſſe be not vnderſtood of all the heares, yet is Latine euen by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of one of the moſt learned Proteſtants
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2119:47"/> of this age. The common language in the world and vnderſtood by many. And ſo this citation is no leſſe in effect then a falſification of the foreſaid Father; as is likewiſe another which followeth out of S. Ambroſe whom the knight produceth to the ſame purpoſe, yet citing his wordes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what corruptedly, which he rehearſeth in this manner. <hi>There were certaine Iewes among the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians as namely the Corinthians who did celebrate the diuine ſeruice and the Sacrament ſometimes in the Syriake, and moſt commonly in the Hebrew ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue which the people vnderſtood not.</hi> Thus the knight citeth S. Ambroſe in his Comentary v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the fourth chapter of the firſt to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: but his wordes which I haue reade, in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin are theſe. <hi>Hi ex Hebraeis erant qui aliquando Syra lingua, plerumque Hebraea in tractatibus aut oblationibus vtebantur ad commendationem, gloria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur enim ſe dici Hebraeos propter meritum Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hae.</hi> Thus S. Ambroſe, where as you ſee that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands Latin, there be neither the words <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice,</hi> nor the word <hi>ſacrament</hi> to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, but <hi>in tractatibus &amp; oblationibus,</hi> that is as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in their <hi>exhortations and ſacrifices.</hi> That which as it ſeemes S. Humfrey did deceitfully tranſlate otherwiſe then the wordes doe ſound and ſignifie, leaſt it might appeare to his reader that the Iewes conuerted, euen in thoſe primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue times did celebrate ſacrifice as the Roman
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2119:48"/> Church doth now, and not ſuch a drye <hi>Rapſodie</hi> as the reformers doe in theſe our daies. But that which is moſt remarkable of all, it is manifeſt out of the ſame S. Ambroſe in the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> did not condemne that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Iewes as contrary to the lawe of God, as the ſectaries doe, but onely that he ſought to bring them from it as a thing leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in regard of the Grecians amonge whom they liued, and that in reſpect of their exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or inſtructions which the Corinthians could not vnderſtand in Hebrew or Syriacke. That which manifeſtly appeareth in the verie ſame wordes of S. Ambroſe immediatly prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent where ſpeaking of the ſenſe and meaning of the Apoſtle in the place vpon which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menceth ſaith onelie: <hi>vtilius est paucis verbis in apertione ſermonis loqui quod omnes intelliga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t quam prolixam orationem habere in obſcuro,</hi> that is to ſay: <hi>it is more profitable to ſpeake few wordes in plaine ſpeach which all may vnderſtand, then to haue a long oration or praier in obſcurity.</hi> Beſides this: thoſe laſt words: <hi>which the common people vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not,</hi> are none of S. Ambroſes, but added by Sir Humfrey and foiſted in as if they had beene the reaſon yeelded by S. Ambroſe, why the Iewes did amiſſe in vſing their ſeruice in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne language, whereas yet he expreſſely ſaith they did it <hi>for oſtentation and commendation,</hi> ſo that S. Humfrey dealeth heere deceiptfully in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2119:48"/> diuers reſpectes for the aduantage of his falſe cauſe. For iuſtification of the which he vttereth a moſt impudent vntruth in his owne wordes following: affirming, that <hi>Sainct Paule wrote that whole chapter of the fourteenth of the firſt to the Corinthians expreſſely against prayer or diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in an vnknowne tongue,</hi> whereas in truth the Apoſtle expreſſely and directly laboureth onely to perſuade the Corinthians that it is better to propheſie, that is, to interpret Scriptures, then to exerciſe <hi>donum linguarum,</hi> the done or guift of tongues. And altho' the Apoſtle in one place makes mention of prayer or prayſing of God in generall ſaying, <hi>ſi benedixeris lingua &amp;c.</hi> yet he neither maketh expreſſe mention of publike ſeruice in a knowne language, nor giueth anie precept about it, but onely preferreth that praier which he who prayeth vnderſtandeth before that which he vnderſtandeth not; and that not abſolutelie, but onelie with relation to that time; leauing it for future times to the diſcretion of the Church to be determined according to the condition &amp; nature of the perſons that liue in it, and other circumſtances. Alwaies ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that although, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> ſome one thing be better then another euen <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> yet by ſome notable change of the time, place, or perſons, that ſame thing which once was more profitable, may afterwardes become leſſe profitable, yea and ſometimes quite vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2119:49"/> or at the leaſt of very ſmall eſtimation, and importance. And yet for all this our Puritanicall crue runne ſo a madding with their Bible craſte, that they will needes haue a precept where none is, rather then want their wils, eſpecially if it be to Croſſe the Papiſts. That which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not appeare more plainely then in the matter of which we now treate, where the knight for the concluſion of his diſcourſe citeth Sainct Paul his wordes in forme of a precept, as if he had ſaid <hi>pray with the ſpirit, praye with the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo,</hi> whereas the Apoſtles wordes are onely theſe, <hi>orabo ſpiritu, orabo &amp; mente, that is I will pray with my ſpirit, I will pray with my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> in which forme of ſpeach you ſee there is no forme of precept or commaund at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one will corrupt the text as he hath done.</p>
                     <p>The knight alſo cites one <hi>Wolfius</hi> as affirming that Pope <hi>Vitalian</hi> firſt introduced Latin ſeruice &amp; praier in an vnknowne tonge. But he might haue ſaued the labor of citing that authour whom he knowes we doe not admit as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent witneſſe in regarde we finde him to be a wolfe indeed that is an enemie to our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and for ſuch he is noted in the Index Epurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. How be it we doe not denie but that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi> for the conſeruation of vniformity in the publike ſeruice of the Church might make a generall ordinance in that particular and extend the practiſe of ſome particular and moſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches of the Weſt in which Latin ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2119:49"/> was euer vſed, to all the reſt of the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall Churches. Neuertheleſſe we denie that by this action he either did contrarie to Gods lawe or renewe the hereſie of the <hi>Oſſeni</hi> which I haue shewed all readie out of <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> to haue beene of a farre different nature notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding out aduerſarie doth indeuoure falſelie to perſuade the ſame to his ſimple reader nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this as the knight vntruelie affirmes to introduce ſeruice in a ſtrange language, but rather in the moſt knowne in the world &amp; that in which moſt nations agree: and ſo this may ſerue to demonſtrate that the Romaniſts deriue not this parte of their Pedagane fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> auncient heretikes (as our aduerſarie doth calumniate) but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the practiſe of the moſt au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Church at the leaſt in the weſt partes of the world to wit the Apoſtolicall Church. And heare we ſee alſo that Sir Humfrey in ſteede of deriuing the Pedegree of the Roman faith from Iewes and heretikes he deriues his owne from the Father of lyes that is from the abuſe of both ſcriptures and auncient Fathers of the Catholike Church.</p>
                     <p>In the next braunch of the Pedegree he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placeth tranſſubſtantiation, going about to proue that it was the doctrine or at leaſt the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of certaine heretikes named <hi>Helceſaitae,</hi> who faigned a two fould Chriſt as (ſaith Sir Humfrey) the Maſſe Preiſts doe, who admit one bodie with all his dimentions and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2119:50"/> in heauen, and other in the Sacrament which hath noe properties of a true bodie. Thus Sir Humfrey talkes moſt abſurdely, ignorantly and falſely. Ignorantly for that according to this diſcourſe he houldes the want of locall dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or properties of a bodie ſufficient to cauſe an abſolute, indiuiduall, &amp; ſuſtantiall diuerſitie in it, and to diſtinguish it really from it ſelfe and ſo to make it an other diſtinct bodie which is ſo voyde of reaſon that if he had not bene groſſely ignorant in Philoſophie haue he would neuer vttered ſuch doctrine vnworthie of other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation them a ſchoole ſtampe or hiſſe. He ſpeake alſo falſely firſt in that he either affirmes or ſuppoſes Preiſts to admit that Chriſts bodie in the Sacrament is without anie properties of a true bodie. For they all contrarily teach and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that as Chriſts bodie in the Sacrament is the ſame which is in heauen, ſo hath it all the ſame properties excepting locall extenſion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he ſpeakes falſelie in that he Fathereth that on Preiſts which none of them either thought or tought, and ſo makes them guiltie if the Helceſaits hereſie onelie for that which he hath forged in his owne phantaſticall braine. Alſo abuſing the authority of learned Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret in miſaplying his words in which he vtters not anie iot or title by which it can be gathered that theſe heretikes meant of Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament when they faigned a double Chriſt;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2119:50"/> but of two viſible Chriſts, the one aboue I knowe not where, and the other belowe in the world or I knowne not where els: adding that the ſupernall Chriſt did in former times liue in manie, but at being deſcended from aboue. And more, they ſayde, he paſſed into other bodies, &amp; other ſuch like fabulous ſtuffe they haue of Chriſt which neuer enterd into the cogitations of any people of learning and iudgement; and therefore it is as great dotage in Sir Humfrey to impoſe this vpon Catholike Roman Preiſts as it was in the authour to inuentit, as will yet more plainely appeare by the formall words of Theodoret which here I put in the margin.<note place="margin">Chriſtum autem non vnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dicunt (Helceſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae) ſed hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c quidem infernè, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum verò ſupernè, &amp; eum olim in multis habitaſſe, poſtremò autem deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diſſe.

                     <p>By which words let the reader if he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Latin iudge how voyde of grace is he who ſo shameleſſelie applies this to the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Euchariſt by Preiſts of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</p>
                     <p>And yet the prepoſterous knight not being content to haue ſpoken ſo irreaſonably, yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addes that the authours of tranſſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were thoſe diſciples that beleaued the the groſſe &amp; carnall eating of Chriſts Flesh. From whence he would deduce that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts deſcend from the Iudaicall Capharnaits in this point.</p>
                     <p>But this is a moſt groſſe and ridiculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of him to imagin that they can be ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours to ſuch as refuſed expreſſely and abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely to beleeue that ſame which they hould for a matter of faith tho' not in the ſame groſſe manner which thoſe incredulous diſciples of Chriſt did apprehend, and as you alſo not like reformers but deformers out of the madneſſe of your noddles groſſely conceiue them to doe:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2119:51"/> but in a much more ſpirituall manner, and yet, truely, really and ſubſtantially, and not onely in ſpirit as your priuate ſpirits would haue it. Which, if it were ſo onely, it were not the true Sacrament, which neceſſarily requires to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine really and not by faith onely that which it repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: but it were onely a meere shadowe or figure of a Sacrament as the ſacrifice of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech, the manna and bread of Propoſition were ſignes and figures of the Sacrament of the holie Euchariſt as not containing but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the body and blo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de there contained.</p>
                     <p>And ſuppoſing that Sir Humfrey himſelfe abſolutely denies the reall preſence of Chriſts body and bloud in the Sacrament, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing alſo that as S. Iohn doth teſtifie the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharnaits did alſo refuſe to beleeue the ſame, this fable of Sir Humfrey, <hi>mutat o nomine,</hi> may much more aptely and truely be verified of him and his companions (I will not ſay then of the Romaniſts) but euen then of the Capharnaits themſelues; in regarde the Capharnaites, as farre as can be gathered by the text of the ſixt of S. Iohn, did according to the interpretation of S. Auguſtin but onely make queſtion of the reall prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or poſſibility of Chriſts giuing his bodie to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that groſſe manner which they then conceiued in their mindes, whereas yet the knight and the reſt of his congregation directly &amp; abſolutely affirme
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2119:52"/> that Chriſts body and blood are as farre from being really contained in the Sacrament as heuen is from the altar or Communion table. And thus it appeares that by indeauouring to make vs Capharnaites, Sir Humfrey showes greater groſſeneſſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipte them the groſſe Capharnaites did by denying the reall preſence vpon the ſame or like carnall imagination for for which he and his mates renounce it.</p>
                     <p>From this Sir Humfrey paſſes to another parte of his Pedegree wher he putteth in the Popes ſupremacie as if it were deriued funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally from the Gentils, and to this purpoſe he applies the wordes of our Sauiour Lucae. 22.25. ſo ridiculouſly that it makes me thinke he is will read in the booke of Quodlibets or quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, he makes vſe of Scripture ſo ingeniouſly.</p>
                     <p>The wordes of our Sauiour are theſe. <hi>The King of the Gentils exerciſe Lordship ouer them, and they that exerciſe authority vpon them are called benefactours.</hi> Out of which place Sir Humfrey will needes inferre and prooue that the Gentiles haue giuen the Pope his ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and conſequently that they are the benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours and founders of the Roman faith in that particular. Which paſſage of the Scripture how falſely and impertinently it is applied and how contrary to the true ſenſe thoſe words of our Sauiour are vſed and abuſed by the knight, I will not ſpend time in examination of it, but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2119:52"/> leaue to the iudicious reader to cenſure of it as he pleaſeth: onely I cannot omitte to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how he concludeth this his idle diſcourſe with another place of Scripture, out of the 20. of S. Math. where our Sauiour ſaith to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whoſoeuer will be greate amonght you, let him be your miniſter, &amp; whoſoeuer will be chiefe among you, let him be your ſeruant: by which words it is moſt appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; agreed vpon by all interpreters, except the nouelliſts, that our Sauiour intended nothing els but to giue his diſciples a leſſion of humility, not ſo that they ought not in any caſe to haue ſuperiority and dominion in that nature one ouer an other, which were to deſtroy the Hierarchy &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church which he himſelfe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, but that thoſe who were to haue it should not abuſe it by dominiering tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nically ouer their ſubiects or ſubordinates. And yet Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey I know not by what rule of Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, will needs extract out of this place that his and his fellowes doctrine touching the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is receaued from Chriſt himſelfe. But in trueth with all my Logike I cannot vnderſtand how he inferreth any thing hence for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe except he will deduce <hi>ex quolibet quodlibet,</hi> and make a noſe of way of the holy Scripture as indeed he doth very frequently, framing ſuch a ſenſe to the wordes as maketh for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and thence deduceing arguments for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2119:53"/> proofe of the ſame. And if one were diſpoſed to make vſe of Scripture in that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, he might-aſwell inferre out of this place a kinde of ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie for the miniſtrie, eſpecially if we write the word miniſter with a greate M. as Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey doth. And indeede I muſt confeſſe that your miniſters are greate among you in diuerſe reſpects. For ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue greate Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rikes, others greate benefices, and allmoſt all greare wiues and greate ſtore of children. And if the King would be pleaſed to ſuffer them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why might they not come to obtaine the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie euery one is his turne by ſucceſſion, &amp; in that caſe they might doubtleſſe make farre better vſe of the cited places of Scripture in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of themſelues then they doe in applying them againſt the Romaniſts. And according to his falſe dealing in applying the Scripture, ſo doth he falſely affirme that the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy was firſt graunted by Phocas falſely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the teſtimony of Vrſpergenſis to that ſame fol. 149. for Valentinian the Emperour who liued aboue 100. yeares before Phocas in his epiſt. to Theodoſius which is extant in the preambles of the Councell of Calced. ſayth of the Bishop of Rome, <hi>to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all antiquity gaue the principalitie of preiſthood aboue all &amp;c.</hi> And as for Viſpergenſis altho' the authoritie of his booke may iuſtely be ſuſpected as hauing ben published by the reformers or rather deformers
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2119:53"/> of Baſill, yet doth he not ſay as Sir Humfrey affirmes that Phocas firſt granted the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to the Bishop of Conſtantinople, but rather the quite contrarie, for thus he ſayth. <hi>Poſt Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grorium Bonifacius ſedit cuius rogatu Phocas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituit ſedem Romanae &amp; Apoſtolicae Eccleſiae caput eſſe omnium Eccleſiarum, cum antea Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politana Eccleſia ſe ſcribebat primam omnium. After Gregorie (ſaith Vrſpergenſis) Bonifacius did ſit at vhoſe requeſt Phocas conſtituted the ſeat of the Roman and Apoſtolicall Church head of all Churches: for before the Church of Conſtantinople writ her ſelfe firſt of all Churches.</hi> So that as the reader may plainely knowe, Sir H. hath falſified Vrſpergenſis relating that to be ſaid by him of the Church of Conſtantinople which he directly ſpeakes of the Church of Rome: which neuertheleſſe is ſo little to his purpoſe that howſoeuer he takes it, being not a gift of the Emperour (as not being in his power ſince that <hi>nemo dat quod non habet</hi>) but onely a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue conſtitution, I cannot conceiue why our aduerſarie should haue corrupted this authour except it were to exerciſe his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Eſpecially ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it is a thing vnpoſſible to apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how either Phocas or anie other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Angell could giue the Pope of Rome his ſupremacie (which is that in this paſſage he intendeth to proue) by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferring the ſame (according to our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries relation) vpon the Bishop of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2119:54"/> And ſo I leaue this for one of S. Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>freyes vnintelligible myſteries of his reformed faith.</p>
                     <p>For worship of Images S.

By which it is euident that euen that ſame time the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was lawfully vſed by ſome in one kinde otherwiſe S.

And in like manner the knight abuſeth Bell: tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touching a proofe of his taken from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Nazarites as if he had deriued wholy or chiefly the communion of one ſpecies or
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2119:55"/> kinde from the practiſe of their communion, whereas he doth not ſo, but hauing by other arguments of Scriptures, Fathers, Councells and reaſons ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly eſtablished the doctrine of the Church in that particular; he bringeth that of the Nazarites onely as a confirmation of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Laſtlie the knight concludeth this point with thoſe wordes of S. Luke, drinke you all of this, whereby he would proue that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kindes came from Chriſt, and ſo it did indeede, but not by precept giuen to all in generall, but onelie to thoſe then preſent and to thoſe whome they repreſented as to be their ſucceſſours that is the Apoſtles, and all Prieſts after them but not to anie Puritan or Puritannicall miniſter as not hauing from them anie true ſucceſſion. After theſe paſſages Sir Humfrey proceeds to inuocation of Saints and Aungels, the founders of which he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue bene the heretikes called Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lici, and for this citeth Saint Auguſtine <hi>ad quod vult Deum.</hi> But this is idle for the Angelicalls were heretikes not for the inuocation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, but either for that they held them to haue bene creatours of the world, or in regard they vſed to boaſt of their owne Angelicall manner of life, or becauſe as Saint Auguſtin teſtifieth they were ſo addicted to adore Angels, <note place="margin">Erant in Angelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinati quos Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius iam om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſe teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

But he abuſeth this authour in both thoſe places. And firſt touching the Collyridians both the ſame Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius and others doe expreſſelie teach that they worshipped our bleſſed Ladie idolatrouſly by attributing diuinity &amp; ſacrificying vnto her, or her image a cake of bread or tart as the verie worde it ſelfe in greeke doth ſignifie; and ſo this ſuperſtitious hereſie can be no part of the Popish pedegree. Moreouer Sir Humfrey doth falſelie affirme that Epiphanius calles thes women Idolaters, for he doth not in anie place giue them that generall name, altho' they iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelie deſerued it, but he calles them <hi>ſimulachri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficae</hi> that is ſacrifiers to images, which is an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie as much repugnant to the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes doctrine as it is to Proteſtancie: which worde alone is ſufficient to cleare the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts from the hereſie of thoſe profane people: but this, as it ſeemes, the craftie Cauallier diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled for the aduantage of his falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondlie concerning the hereſie of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2119:58"/> 
                        <hi>Tatians</hi> it is certaine out of that Epiphanius, Ireneus, and others that they reiected Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie abſolutelie and compared it to fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which as the world knowes the Roman Church doth not, but onelie for the greater decencie and reuerence to the ſeruice of God, prohibits it in thoſe onelie who dedicate themſelues to the ſame by receauing holie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and prieſthood. And thus you ſee Sir Humfrey inſteede of deducing the ſucceſſion of the Romaniſts from auncient hereſies, he makes but a Pedegree of his owne lyes. And the like I ſay of the Manicheans whome the knight falſelie, and iniuriouſlie affirmes to haue beene our predeceſſours in that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited mariage in Preiſts quoting in the margent <hi>S.

Epiphanius much in his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions of hereſies, and alſo was better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted then anie writer of his tyme with the errours of the Maniches, that they did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prohibit matrimonie in Preiſts, but that they abſolutelie deteſted the ſame, for ſo he ſaith of thoſe ſectaries. <hi>Verum ſi ad virginitatem ſic ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortamini quemodum hortatur Apostolica doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi>

Finallie you doe cheeflie deteſte that carnall coniunction which onelie is honest and matrimoniall, and which the matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall writings alſo declare to be for procreation of children, whence it is that you doe not ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit

                     <p>And whereas he affirmes that the Maniches were our predeceſſours &amp; prohibited mariage in Preiſts quoting S.

                     <p>IN his eight ſection therefore, Sir Humfrey promiſeth to produce teſtimonies of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries touching the antiquitie and vniuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Proteſtant faith in generall. So he proceedeth in the title. To which he addeth by way of aſſeueration that if the Roman Church doth not confeſſe that the reformers are both in the more certaine and Safer waye in the Proteſtant Church, <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>neither refuſe the name nor the punishment due to hereſie.</hi> Heere we ſee the knight is as free in his promiſes as euer he was, let vs therefore examen how he performeth them, for if he doth not, he cannot eſcape either the name of an heretike, or at the leaſt, the deſert of punishment itſelfe euen in this mortall life.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2119:60"/> Hee beginneth thus. <hi>He that shall question vs where our Church was before Luther, let him looke back to the Primatiue Church: nay let him but looke into the boſome of the preſent Roman Church and he shall finde that if euer antiquitie and vniuerſallitie were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the true Church, of right and neceſsitie they muſt belong to ours.</hi> So Sir Humfrey. In which wordes as it were by way of generall aſſertion he briefelie declareth the antiquitie and vniuerſalitie of his Church to be found both in the Primatiue Church and alſo in the preſent Roman Church, in which aſſertion there being two partes and that no small ones, the firſt he endeauoureth to proue by shewing a conformitie betwene the doctrine of the Church of England with that of the Primatiue Church, and deſcending to particulars he tells vs that his Church teacheth and beleeueth the ſame three Creedes which were inſtituted by the Apoſtles and the Fathers of the Primatiue Church, and not created by Luther: as alſo two of the ſeauen Sacraments which were, ſaith he, by the confeſſion of our aduerſaries inſtituted by Chriſt. The ſame he affirmeth of 22. bookes of Canonicall Scripture which he ſaith were vniuerſallie receiued in all ages. Likewiſe of the ſeuen generall Councells he affirmeth that foure of them were ratified by the Cannons of the Church of England, and confirmed by act
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2119:61"/> of parliament, and thus he runneth through the points of doctrine and faith in which they and we agree, adding to them the confeſſion of his aduerſaries. And yet in all his large rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of points of faith, he maketh no mention of eyther thoſe in which the Romaniſts and reformers diſagree, nor of thoſe new articles of the English Creede which diſſent from the doctrine of the Primatiue Church, and which indeede are thoſe that make the reformers guiltie of hereſie, as its the doctrine of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith onelie, the deniall of the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ſuch like: But craftilie leauing them out as if they were not to the purpoſe he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, whereas in trueth by reaſon of theſe new errours obſtinatelie defended by them, there can be no vniuerſalitie nor antiquitie in their Church notwithſtanding they had neuer ſo great conformitie both to the auncient prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and moderne Roman Church in all the reſt of their beleefe. Eſpeciallie ſuppoſing that anie one errour in matter of faith obſtinatelie defended is ſufficient to take away all true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie and vniuerſallitie of anie Church or congregation whatſoeuer, as euen the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers themſelues, as I ſuppoſe, cannot denie, for that, as the ſcripture affirmeth, that he who offends in one thing is made guiltie of all the reſt, ſo he that in one onelie poynt of faith houldeth contrarie to the moſt vniuerſall and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2119:61"/> auncient Church, maketh himſelfe preſentlie guiltie of want or defect both of vniuerſalitie and antiquitie in his beleefe. For as Saint Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene ſaith to this purpoſe in his 37. <hi>oration</hi> towards the end: the articles of faith are like to a gould chaine from which if you take away anie one link (as Saint Ambroſe ſaith) <note place="margin">Ad cap. 9. Lucae lib. 6. in fine.</note> 
                        <hi>you take away your ſaluation, vnum horum,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſi detraxeris tetraxiſti ſalutem tuam.</hi> And ſo we ſee that the knight by reaſon he omitteth in his diſcourſe that part vpon which the verie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of his argument chiefelie, or at the leaſt greatelie depended, his proofe of antiquitie and vniuerſality in his Church falleth to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. But beſides this defect he fayleth alſo in that he ſaith he beleeueth the three Creedes inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the Apoſtles and Primatiue Fathers of the Church. For either he meanes that thoſe three Creedes do ſufficientlie conteyne all that he is bound to beleeue or no. If the firſt he meaneth, then what will become of his ſolifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian iuſtification, and of the 39. articles of the English faith, the greater parte of which is not to be found in thoſe Creedes. If he meanes the ſecond, then doth he ill in leauing thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars out in the rehearſall of his faith. Nay more then this, for if matters were well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, I doubt not but the knight notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his faith of the three Creeds, yet he would be founde holting in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2119:62"/> true &amp; generally receiued, or Catholike se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe of diuers of the ſame, as that of the perpetuall vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity of the mother of God, in that of the deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt in to hell, of the Catholike Church, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Saincts, remiſſion of ſinnes, and the like I ſay of the doctrine of the 4. firſt Generall Councels, and of the Sacraments: in which particulars our aduerſaries vnderpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maintaine diuers deformed errours, ſpecified and confuted by diuines of the Roman Church. Moreouer the knight is alſo defectiue in the proofe of the antiquitie and vniuerſalitie of his faith, and doth egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly equiuocate in that he ſaith that two of the Sacraments which the Church of Rome houldeth, are profeſſed by the reformers and confeſſed by their aduerſaries to haue beene inſtituted by Chriſt, not broached by Luther. This I ſay is equiuocall and doth not prooue his intent: for although it neither is nor can be denied, but ingenuouſly confeſſed by the Roman Church that there are two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet doth she not confeſſe that there are onely two Sacraments inſtituted by Chriſt as the reformers profeſſe, but houldeth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth fiue more as well as thoſe two to haue beene inſtituted by Chriſt, which fiue being denyed, or at the leaſt three or foure of them, both by Luther and the reſt of the pretended reformers, and on the contrary hauing beene
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2119:62"/> receiued for Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient times, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards shall be declared, the deniers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they be, cannot rightly claime either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of vniuerſality of doctrine in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. And the ſame may be ſaid for the ſame reaſon of the 22. bookes of Scripture, and the ſeuen firſt generall Councells, in the which he faith of the reformers is neither auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall firſt for that they hould thoſe twenty two bookes for canonicall Scripture &amp; exclude all the reſt out of the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which neuertheleſſe as appeareth by the teſtimony of S.

                     <p>And now touching Apoſtolicall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Sir Humfrey doth no leſſe plainely So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticate then in the former points, for that it is well knowne that the reformers either hould no traditions at all to be beleeued but rely wholy vpon pure or ſole Scripture as the totall rule of their faith: or if they hould any traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be neceſſary yet do not they hould all thoſe which the auncient &amp; now the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Roman Church doth hould, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2119:63"/> their manner of houlding Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call traditions is in words onely, and hath no true diſcent from the Apoſtles nor any vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality or antiquity at all, as neither hath their booke of common prayer &amp; manner of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and vocation of Miniſters or Paſtours: and ſo altho' they haue ſome parte both of the auncient liturgie and alſo of the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ordination, yet becauſe they doe not wholy agree with them, no not in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and eſſentiall parts of the action, that is to ſay not in the conſecration of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, nor in the eſſentiall forme and matter of order which are the wordes and impoſition of hands, they are defectiue in the antiquity and vniuerſality of the ſame in regard that the manner and forme of prayer and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Sacraments which the reformed Churches vſe at this preſent is different from that of the auncient Church, &amp; neuer knowne nor heard of in former ages but broach by Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his ſectatours, quite contrary to that which the knight affirmeth and indeauoureth to prooue, as by comparing their Church ſeruice, their booke of common prayer, and of ordination of Miniſters with the auncient liturgies, as that of Sainct Iames, Sainct Baſil, Sainct Chriſoſtome and others, doth clearely appeare: as alſo by confronting the ſame with the writings of the auncient Fathers and their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2119:63"/> formes of adminiſtration of Sacraments, by which we shall finde a maine difference bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt the one and the other in regard that in thoſe auncient monuments of antiquitie, be founde ſacrifice, oblation, altar, incenſe, hoſte, chalis, holy oyle, Chryſme and the like: But in the forme of ſeruice and adminiſtration of Sacraments vſed now in the pretenſiue refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, ther is none of this to be found or hearde. By which it may farther appeare that it is no ſilly or ſenſeles queſtion, as our aduerſarie would haue it, to demaunde of the reformers where their Church was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Luther. Becauſe it hath nowe beene made manifeſt that allthough ſome parte of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that I meane in which they and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts agree, hath both vniuerſality and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity if it be conſidered in it ſelfe, yet diuerſe other points of it hath neither the one nor the other. That which cannot be found in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church for that allthough it is true that ſome parte thereof was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely definde as matter of faith before the tyme of the later Councells, and ſectaries, who by their defection from the euer ſucceeding Roman Church, and their new errours, gaue occaſion of new declarations of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar points, yet were thoſe neither new in them ſelues nor firſt broached &amp; taught by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid councells, but onely they by their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2119:64"/> determined &amp; eſtablished for certaine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that which diuerſe nouelliſts preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly brought in queſtion, the ſame neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe in all the ages before Luther hauing bene both aunciently and vniuerſally tought, or at the leaſt by many doctours of the Church with out contradiction of the reſt: or perhaps if anie were of a different opinion, it was becauſe matters were not then ſo plainely declared by the Church, and vnder her correction. And ſo the queſtion propoſed by the Romaniſts to the reformers can neither be rightly detorted vpon them, as the knight vainely auerreth, nor yet can the reformers euer be able to anſwer it, as plainely appeareth both by that with hath beene allready ſaid, as allſo by the doctrine of their 39. articles diuerſe of which are not onely new in themſelues and neuer heard of in aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tymes, but allſo expreſſely broached by Luther himſelfe, and that not only in negatiue but allſo in ſome poſitiue doctrine, as is euident particularly in the point of iuſtiſicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith alone. And hence allſo it is manifeſtly infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how vntruely the knight affirmeth in his 77. page that noe Romaniſt can deny but that the doctrine of the reformers lay inuolued in the boſome of the Roman Church as corne couered with chaffe or gould with droſſe: for neither is it true that either all the doctrine of the reformers hath beene in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2119:64"/> Church before Luther, as I haue showed, nor yet that any Romaniſt euer affirmed the ſame, &amp; ſo S. Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey deliuereth two falſities vnder one forme of ſpeech continuing the ſame for the ſpace of a whole leafe grounding his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſe ſuppoſitions, &amp; equiuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; promiſing to produce teſtimonies of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie the Romaniſts for the antiquity and vniuerſalitie of the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t faith (he meanes the Puritan faith) in generall, yet produceth not one for the ſame excepting Pope Adrian the 6. and Coſterus and D.

Coſterus and Harding onely ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of one or two particular points &amp; that in no matter of faith, to wit aboute the manner of the introduction of communion vnder one kinde and priuate Maſſe into the Church, as their owne wordes declare.</p>
                     <p>And as for Pope Adrian, his owne wordes truely and compleatly cyted showe him to ſpeake onely of the conditionall adoration of Chriſt in the Euchariſt in caſe the hoſte should not be conſecrated, and ſo he is here produced by the knight both moſt falſely and moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly to proue, for ſooth, that the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts excuſe their abſolute adoration of Chriſt in the Sacrament by that conditionall, I adore theif thou be Chriſt: which manner of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neuertheleſſe they neuer vſe but onely in

Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>freys purpoſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing abſolutely that the Romaniſts excuſe their adoration of Chriſt in that manner. Further more Sir Humfrey doth not adduce any reaſon at all for the proofe of his antiquitie and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality, but onely vſeth his owne conceiptes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting mearely in iffes an andes, or conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall aſſeueratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; thus quite throu' the reſt of his ſection he rides poſte like a man that caries newes of a falſe victorie now and then drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a lye by the way for the haſte he maketh to come to the end of his iourney, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but his owne diſcredit: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath beene already ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted I neede not goe to particulars for more proofe of the ſame, eſpecially for that I know I shall haue occaſion hereafter to handle more largely all thoſe ſeuerall points which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſteth in this place rather by way of recrimination then of treaty, as that Coſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus &amp; Harding excuſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Maſſe, the one by ſaying that the cup was not taken away by the commaundement of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2119:65"/> the Bishops, but that it crept in the Bishops conniuing ther at, which he attributeth to Coſterus: the other, that it is throu the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the lay people that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate not at euerie Maſſe, which he aſcribes to D. Harding. All which is impoſed by the knight vpon thoſe two Catholike authours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to their true ſenſe and meaning, for that as it is apparent by their owne wordes which I will rehearſe in an other place, they ſay not thoſe things by way of excuſe in regarde they know ther is no need of excuſe wher no faulte is founde nor acknowledged: it being certaine to them and all other Romaniſts that how ſoeuer priuate Maſſe, and ſingle communion were at firſt introduced, yet they are both lawfully practized. And ſo I conclude this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his, inroling il with the former cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: or rather I may with greate reaſon frame a more rigorous cenſure for it, in regard that the knight hauing promiſed more then before, yet he hath performed leſſe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnder the name and punishment due to hereſie vndertaken to showe by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies &amp; confeſſion of his aduerſaries the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and vniuerſalitie of his faith, &amp; that his way euen by the confeſſion of the Romaniſts is more certaine then their owne, yet he hath performed nothing but ſpent his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in equiuocations and iuggeling tricks,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2119:66"/> and ſo he cannot poſſible eſcape the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which his owne execration called vpon him.</p>

The firſt parte is clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely falſe in of it affirmeth that the prieſts and profeſſours both before and after the conqueſt proteſted openly againſt Romish merits. That this is falſe it is manifeſtly conuinced firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the workes of learned men, and hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries both of England and other contries that write of that matter, doe teſtifye that from the tyme of S.

As is diligently proued by the authour of the proteſtants apollogie in the firſt ſection of his firſt treaty the 63. page euen by the teſtimonies of Proteſtants themſelues. And what S. Gregories owne doctrine was in this particular, he himſelfe teſtifieth in his booke of moralls the 42. chap. ſaying that <hi>becauſe in this life there is diuerſitie of workes

                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:2119:67"/> could not be openly proteſted againſt both before and after the Conqueſt by the Preiſts and profeſſours of England, except Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey will perſuade vs that the faith of England in thoſe times was different from the faith of all the world beſide, and euen of thoſe who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſent preachers for the conuerſion of it from gentiliſme and ſuperſtition, all which being wholely incredible, ſo by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is the whole diſcourſe grounded thereupon. Secondly I anſwer that its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt out of the words cited by the knight out of the booke of the forme of adminiſtration of Sacraments vſed in thoſe times (ſuppoſing the booke is authenticall, which neuertheleſſe may be ſuſpected as being being onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Caſſander a ſuſpected authour) there is not any word, ſentence, or ſillable which excludes from ſaluation thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which the Roman Church defendeth: but onely ſuch merits as either exclude, preſſely exclude the merits of the paſſion of Chriſt and therefore the queſtion which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of that directory the Prieſt maketh to the ſick perſon runneth in this tennour. <hi>Doeſt thou belieue to come to glorie not by thine owne merits, but by the virtue and merits of the Paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt?</hi> which interrogation as you ſee manifeſtly containeth an oppoſition betwene
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2119:68"/> the merits of the infirme man and thoſe of Chriſt, and for that cauſe he calleth them his owne as being wholy wrought by his owne naturall power without the concourſe of the merits of our Sauiour &amp; conſequently in that ſenſe of no force or vertue for the obtaining of ſaluation. That which is yet more manifeſt by the like queſtion inſuing made alſo by the Preiſt to the ſame perſon in this manner. <hi>Doest thou belieue that our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt did die for our ſaluation?</hi> And that none can be ſaued by his owne merits or by any other meanes but by the merits of his paſſion? where you ſee the oppoſition ſtill runneth, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially heare more clearely, betwixt mans owne merits or other meanes which proceed not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſts Paſſion, but from ſome other cauſe, not including or depending vpon them as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall agent of all meritorious operations.</p>
                     <p>And verily I am perſuaded that the reaſon why in thoſe daies &amp; in thoſe occaſions the formes and ſpeach where ſomewhat different in the matter of merit, from the formes vſed in our times, is no thing elſ but the differences of errours reigning in the worlde in thoſe times, and thoſe that are now at this preſent defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the nouelliſts. For the Pelagian hereſie which did attribute ouer much virtue to the merits of man hauing once beene and perhaps ſome requikes of it yet remaining verie rife in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2119:68" rendition="simple:additions"/> Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foreſaid directory was vſed (if any ſuch there were) or at the leaſt not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was neceſſary that in all occaſions hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane merits should be as much extenuated as could poſſible be without preiudice of faith in that point. But contrarilie in theſe our daies ſince the publication of the errours of Luther and other ſectaries in this matters, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, if not neceſſary, to extoll the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as much as could be without preiudice to the merits of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now touching that which is added in the ſecond parte of the knigts aſſertion videlicet, that the Preiſts of former times preached ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation through Chriſt alone, it is moſt plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely equiuocall, and in one ſenſe it is true and conformable to the doctrine of the Roman Church in all ages, but in another ſenſe it is falſe and diſagreable to the ſame, it is true that Chriſt alone is the authour of ſaluation and that no other then he can ſaue vs according to that of the Apoſtle Sainct Peter <hi>Act.</hi> 4. <hi>non eſt in alio aliquo ſalus. Nec enim aliud nomen est ſub Caelo datum hominibus in quo oporteat nos ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uos fieri. Neither is there any other name vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen giuen to men wherein we muſt be ſaued:</hi> and in this ſenſe and no otherwiſe the Preiſts of England in more auncient times preached ſaluation by Chriſt alone: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, it is falſe that thoſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2119:69"/> Preiſts preached ſaluation with an excluſion or deniall of the merits of man wrought by the grace of Chriſt and by virtue of his death and Paſſion, neither was ſuch doctrine euer taught either in England or any other place before the time of Luther, except it were by ſome more au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient heretikes. Moreouer that which the knight putteth in the ſecond parte of his foreſaid aſſertion, to wit that the Preiſts of thoſe times published and adminiſtred the ſame Sacraments in the ſame faith and trueth, which they (meaning the reformers) teach &amp; adminiſter this day, this I ſay is partelie equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocall in that he ſaith they publike profeſſed &amp; adminiſtred the ſame Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For tho' it were true that two of the Sacraments which thoſe Preiſts adminiſtred videlicet. Baptiſme &amp; the Euchariſt, be the ſame which there formers adminiſter at this day, yet it is falſe that the foreſaid Prieſts did the vſe in their time either to profeſſe or adminiſter two onelie, as may appeare by the ſame rituall out of which S. Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey draweth this teſtimonie, in which all the ſeauen Sacraments are contained and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be adminiſtred, if the booke be perfectly published without corruption. Partelie alſo that ſame parte of the aſſertion is falſe, for that it is manifeſt the foreſaid Preiſts did not receiue thoſe two which the reformers hould for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in the ſame faith which they doe, for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2119:69"/> as much as the Prieſts mentioned receiued thoſe two in the faith of fiue other Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which alſo they beleiue to be ſuch as well as the reſt, ſuppoſing that the number of all the ſeuen Sacraments were then in beleefe and practice as much as now they bee, as both the rituall cited, if it be not corrupted, and alſo the hiſtories of thoſe times can teſtifie, of which fiue Sacraments neuertheleſſe the reformers haue no ſuch faith as they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe. To ſay nothing of the faith of thoſe ſame Preiſts in other points of religion, which as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by the relation of hiſtoriographes, was farre different from the faith of the reformers and practice of their Churches, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie it cannot with truth be ſaid to be the ſame. And as for the reſt of the words which the knight citeth out of the ſame rituall, they proue nothing againſt merit it ſelfe but onelie againſt confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in proper merits as appeares by thoſe wordes in particular, <hi>place thy whole confidence in his death onelie, haue confidence in no other thing,</hi> that which is ſo farre from the deniall of merits as that it is counſelled &amp; aduiſed euen by thoſe who are moſt profeſſed defendours of the Roman doctrine in that point as out of Bellarmine and other diuines we haue showed before.<note place="margin">Period. 4.</note> Nay and beſides this it is moſt plaine in my iudgment that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid rituall in certaine other words following
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2119:70"/> in the ſame place did neuer intend to exclude all kinde of merit from the workes of man performed by Gods grace and aſſiſtance, for that it expreſſely ſaith in the perſon of that ſick man: <hi>I offer his merits</hi> (that is the merits of Chriſt) <hi>in steede of the merits I ought to haue,</hi> for if he ought to haue merits as he affirmeth euen vpon his death bed, though he haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, euident it is that he denied not the ſame but plainelie ſuppoſed the truth of them. And thus we ſee that the words of the order of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing benigniouſlie interpreted make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for S. Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>freyes poſition nor againſt the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine of merits, How be it the ſame was iuſtelie corrected by the Inquiſitors both becauſe the manner of phraſe which it vſeth might eaſily giue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of errour eſpecially in theſe our dayes: as alſo becauſe it is iuſtelie ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be Apochryphall, in regarde it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines certaine ill ſounding ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces not onely in the doctrine of the Roman Church: but alſo according to the tenets of the Reformers. As where it ſaith thus. <hi>Theſe proteſtations of ſuch as lye a dying were reuailed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine religious man. And thoſe wordes: he that shall protest ſuch things as followe, from his harte cannot be damned &amp;c.</hi> All which propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and ſome othgers are commaunded by the authours of the Index to be blotted as well as the wordes which Sir Humfrey here cites.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2119:70"/> And yet more ouer it is to be aduertiſed that there is not a worde in all that which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie produceth againſt merits which doth proue iuſtification by faith onelie, which is that which he intendes to proue in this place as the title of his paragraph doth declare. And ſo by this meanes he hath quite fled from his text. And ſo this may ſuffice to demonſtrate the falſitie of the knights aſſertion and the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the proofe thereof by the teſtimonies of his aduerſaries, ſeeing plainelie that he doth no thing therein, but partlie by vntrueths and partlie by equiuocations deludes his reader not citing anie one authour either Romaniſt or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former in all this paragraffe more then the wordes rehearſed out of the foreſaid Rituall, which neuertheleſſe hauing bene, as ſuſpected of corruption, chaſticed by the Inquiſitours, the vncenſured coppies (which doubtleſſe he and his fellowes onelie vſe) haue no authoritie nor credit in the Roman Church, or at the moſt, verie little, and conſequentlie he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth moſt weakelie in produceing for a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of his aduerſarie that which they doe not acknowledge for theirs, eſpeciallie conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he alledgeth nothing els for the proofe of his tenet. The ſecond paragraffe is of the Euchariſt and Tranſubſtantiation. <hi>As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacraments of the Lords ſupper</hi> ſaith the knight. <hi>In the dayes of Alfrick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2119:71"/> the yeare</hi> 996. <hi>There was a Homilie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikelie to be read to the people one Eaſter day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein the ſame doctrine which, ſaith hee, our Church now profeſſeth was publikelie taught and receaued, and the doctrine of the reall preſence (which in that time had gotte ſome footing in the Church) was plainelie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed and reiected.</hi> The wordes which he citeth are theſe. <hi>There is a greate difference betwixt the bodie wherein Christ ſuffered and the bodie which is receaued of the faithfull, the bodie that Chriſt ſuffered in it was borne of the flesh of marie with bloud and with bone, with skinne and with ſinewes, in human lims, with a reaſonable ſoule liuing: and his ſpirituall bodie which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth the faithfull ſpirituallie, is gathered of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie cornes without bloud and bone, without lim, without ſoule, and therefore there is nothing to be vnderſtood bodilie but ſpirituallie &amp;c. Thus farre out of the homilie. And this doctrine faith the knight was deliuered in thoſe times not by one onely Bishop but by diuerſe in their Synods and by them commended to the Clergie, who were commaunded to reade it publikelie to the people one Eaſter day for their better preparation and inſtruction in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> and for the ſame cauſe tranſlated into the ſaxon language by Alfrick: and to the ſame purpoſe the Knight alſo citeth two other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges or Epiſtles as published and tranſlated alſo into the vulgar tongue by the ſame Alfric.</p>
                     <p>But to this I anſwer firſt that whatſoeuer do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2119:71"/> is conteynd in the Hom. &amp; Epiſtles cited, the Romaniſts are not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to beleeue it, becauſe the knight onely citeth them out of his owne authours and as printed by the members of his owne Church, to wit out of B. Vsher, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour Iames, and ſo it is both abſurd and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to produce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as teſtimonies of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, as he profeſſeth to doe in the title of his ſection, eſpecially ſuppoſing that he hath not aledged any one author of the Romaniſts religion where by to proue them authenticall, nor yet any other indifferent witneſſe, but onely thoſe two reformers whom we haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whoe by the Romaniſts may iuſtly be ſuſpected of partiallity in fauour of their owne cauſe, eſpecially if we conſider that Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey himſelfe graunteth that <hi>the Latin epiſtle written by Alfric is to be ſeene mangled and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in a manuſcript in Benet colledg in Cambridge.</hi> And certainely the English coppies being found not to aggree with the Latin manuſcript which is either the Originall it ſelfe, or at the leaſt cometh much neerer the time in which the authour of it liued, then any other coppie the knight could poſſible haue, there is farre greater euidence that the latter tranſlations and impreſſions are corrupted by the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, then that either the Index expurgatorius or any other Romaniſt hath made any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or chaunge in the originall coppies or firſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2119:72"/> authenticall manuſcripts, or in any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were onely to reſtore them to their prime innocenty and originall trueth: chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely ſuppoſing that the inquiſitors in their expurgation of bookes intend no other thing more then to reduce ſuch as be corrupted to the former purity of their originalls. Thirdly I anſwer that admitte the editions which are published in England be true and ſincerely tranſlated and printed, which neuertheleſſe may iuſtly be ſuſpected by reaſon of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fould corruptions found to haue bene vſed in that nature by diuerſe of the reformed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as by the expurgatory Index doth plainely appeare, the authours of which Index haue diſcouered diuers workes Fathered par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely by auncient and partely by moderne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe who neuer writ them: which was the cauſe as I ſuppoſe, why Antonius poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuinus in the preamble to his ſelect Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theke ſaith that Sixtus, Bellarmine, and others haue manifeſted very maine peſtilent bookes attributed by heretikes to ancient and good authours among which we may number one cited by Sir Humfrey in ſome parte of his worke, intitled <hi>de fiducia &amp; miſericordia Dei,</hi> which Bell. in his booke de Scrip. Eccleſ. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be counterfait and ſuppoſitious and none of Bishop Fishers on whom it is impoſed. Neuertheleſſe how ſo euer the matter ſtandes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2119:72"/> touching the truth of the foreſaid homilie, and admit it be neuer ſoe true and authenticall: yet I am confidently aſſured that the wordes by Sir Humfrey cited out of it againſt the reall preſence, are not ſo obſcure but that they admitte ſuch a comodious expoſition as doth not in any ſort fouour the denyall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of but rather impugne and it confute it. Firſt for that there is not one worde which inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a denyall of the reall preſence of Chriſts bodie in the Euchariſt, but the wordes onelie showe a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the body in which Chriſt ſuffered and the bodie which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full receiue, which difference is not reallie in the ſubſtance of the bodie it ſelfe, it being one and the ſame in nature in euery place where it exiſteth; but onely in the properties and manner of exiſtence, or being in place: it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene in the paſſion viſible, mortall, and with it entire locall extenſion: but in the Sacrament inuiſible, impaſſible, and vnexten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: in which ſenſe allſo it may rightly be called ſpirituall: yea and not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, eſpecially taking it with a relation or reſpect vnto the ſame body perfectly exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the manner aboue declared, it may be ſaid to be without bloud, bone, ſinn woe, limbe, or ſoule, that is without extenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe partes, as the cited wordes doe ſignifie, which by reaſon of the foreſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2119:73"/> of being of Chriſts body in the Sacrament doe call it his ſpirituall bodie, from thence as it were inferring &amp; concluding that noething is to be vnderſtood there bodily but ſpiritually: all which is noething contrarie to the doctrine of the Romaniſts in this point, but rather moſt agreeable to the ſame, which teacheth that Chriſts body though it be truelie in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet without extenſion and not in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, but in a ſpirituall manner; yea and very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to the doctrine of S. Paul who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the flesh douteth not to call one &amp; the ſame humane bodie both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible &amp; ſpirituall: <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Seminatur corpus animale, ſurget corpus ſpirituale,</hi> and that not for the difference of the bodie in it nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which it hath not but onelie by reaſon of the accidentall difference which it hath in it properties and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of exiſtence, &amp; which the ſame bodie receiueth in the reſurrection not hauing had them in this mortall life. True it is ther is one paſſage in the homilie which in my opinion hath more difficulty &amp; showe of repugnance to the reall preſence &amp; tranſſubſtantiation then the former wordes, to wit where the authour makes a compariſon betwixt the manna and water which flowed from the rocke in the deſert, both which he affirmes to haue beene figures of Chriſt bodie and bloud as the Euchariſt alſo is. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2119:73"/> he hath conſequenter an other paſſage or two which plainely declare that ſimilitude to be nothing contrarie either to the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or tranſſubſtantiation. For ſo he addes. The Apoſtle Paul ſaith that the Iſraeliſts did eate the ſame goſtely meake, and drinke the ſame goſtely drinke, becauſe that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meate that fed them 40. yeares and shat water which frome the ſtome did follow had ſignification of Chriſts bodie &amp; his bloud that now be offered daylie in Gods Church: <hi>it was the ſame</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which we offer, not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily but gostely.</hi> But which wordes it is euident that Alfric puts a maine difference betwixt that ſpirituall meate and drinke of the Iewes, &amp; the ſpirituall foode which Catholike Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians receiue in the Sacrament, that being but a ſignification, as the authour of the Homilie expreſſely affirmeth, of Chriſts body &amp; bloud, it being the ſame not bodilie but onely ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually or figuratiuelie with that bodie and bloud of Chriſt which he auerreth Preiſts to offer daylie and of which he alſo teacheth the foreſaid water to be a repreſentation, not the bodie and bloud themſelues, which as being euerie day ſacrificed in the altar, euen according to common ſenſe they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie be reallie and truelie in the Euchariſt. And altho' the authour of the Homilie calleth if a figure of Chriſts bodie &amp; bloud, yet doth he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2119:74"/> not ſay it is a figure of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abſent, as the water flowing out of the rock was, but truelie and reallie preſent, as thoſe his wordes in which he ſaith and diuers time repeateth, that Chriſts bodie and bloud are offered in the ſame Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt by Preiſts in ſacrifice, doe euidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, ſuppoſing it is impoſſible to conceiue the authour of the homilie should affirme that Chriſts bodie and bloud be offered, in the altar, and yet not beleeue the ſame to be reallie truelie and ſubſtantially preſent in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. Moreouer the ſame Homilie ſaith in plaine termes, <hi>the wine which in the ſupper by the Preiſt is hallowed, shewe one thing without to humane vnderſtanding and another thing with in to beleeuing minds, without they ſeeme bread and wine both in figure and tast, and they be truely after their hallowing Chriſts bodie and his blood throu' goſtelie miſterie.</hi> And afterwardes theſe wordes doe followe, <hi>we ſaid vnto you that Chriſt hallowed bread and wine to houſell before his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſaid this his my bodie and my bloud, yet he had not then ſuffered: but ſo notwithstanding he turned trou' in viſible might the bred to his owne hodie, the wine to his bloud,</hi> which wordes how plaine they be for the reall preſence and tranſſubſtantiation, anie one that is not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently partiall in his owne cauſe may eaſilie perceiue, conſidering that for Chriſt to turne by inuiſible might the bread and wine into
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2119:74"/> his bodie and bloud, is nothing els but that which both the definitions of the Roman Church and Catholike diuines call by the names of reall preſence and tranſſubantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdlie it is manifeſt that the foreſaid teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie cannot in reaſon be alledged in fauour of the reformers doctrine in this particular, for that they denie the bodie of Chriſt either to exiſt or to be receaued really in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt otherwiſe then by faith &amp; figure, neither of which neuerteleſſe is denied by the words aboue cited, but contrarilie they expreſſely and abſolutelie auerre that the bodie of Chriſt is receaued by the faithfull, and altho' they call it his ſpirituall bodie, yet doubtleſſe they doe it onelie for the reaſon alledged as alſo for that it nourisheth the receiuers ſpirituallie, yet they neuer denie it to be a true bodie, or to be trulie preſent in the Sacrament, or affirme it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by faith onelie as the reformers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie doe, and Sir Humfrey in particular moſt expreſſelie in diuerſe places of his booke.</p>
                     <p>Fourtlie the wordes alledged call the bodie which the faithfull receiue in the Euchariſt a bodie gathered of many cornes, without bloud and bone, without lim, without ſoule. But the reformers profeſſe to receiue no ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the Sacrament, but the verie ſame bodie

And from hence we may further deduce how vaine <hi>a flourish the knight maketh</hi> in the end of his 97. page were by way of concluſion he affirmes <hi>that the most ſubſtantiall points of his religion were viſiblie knowne and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie published not in pryuate corners but in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike libraries, not in obſcure aſſemblyes. But in open Churches, and generall congregations of our owne countrye in the darkeſt ages long before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dayes;</hi> All which deduction is moſt fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous and idle: firſt for that ſuppoſe it were moſt true and certaine that the denyall of the reall preſence were contained in the foreſaid writings, the contrarie to which I haue made moſt manifeſt, yet is it a moſt vaine and falſe brag of the knight to ſaye that therefore the moſt ſubſtantiall points of his religion were viſiblie knowne and generallie profeſſed in his countrie longe before the dayes of Luther, it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2119:77"/> being manifeſt that with all the Arethmatik he can vſe, <note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the reall preſence and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation confeſſed by Sir H. to be the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall points of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> the whole ſome of ſubſtantiall points of his religion falſelie pretended to be ſounde by him in the foreſaide epiſtles and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, doe not paſſe the number of two: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas yet on the contrarie ther are truelie and vnfainedlie aboue twiſe as manie againſt him and for the Romaniſts, as maſſe, prayers in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, water mixed to the wine in the chalis, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſame, ſacrifice, the pronouncing of Agnus Dei in the maſſe, the ſigne of the Croſſe. As alſo becauſe there are no certaine premiſſes out of which anie ſuch illation of the knights can be collected, but the quite contrarie as hath beene alreadie showed: and ſo for Sir Humfrey to ſay the moſt ſubſtantiall points of his faith haue beene generallie published not in priuate corners but in publike libraries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dayes of Luther grounding his ſaying onelie vpon the foreſaid writings, is moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde and voyde of truth. To omit that if as the knight affirmes, there is a copie of the foreſaid Epiſtle mangled in the foreſaid librarie a man may doubt how the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiue reformers could come by anie more true manuſcript then that razed copie, out of which they could by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the one with the other, diſcouer that that which was ſo blotted &amp; defaced, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine anie doctrine contrarie to the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe or tranſubſtantiation or agreeing with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2119:78"/> their owne copies now of late tranſlated in to English and printed by them. And alſo we may further ſuſpect that the copie which Sir Humfrey mentioneth as mangled and razed, is the onelie true originall, and that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpts of Alfrickes ſermon now published in English, are altered and changed from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of their firſt copies, all which I leaue to the iudgement of the indifferent reader and my owne further examen of the matter as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie shall ſerue. And yet beſides this, I cannot conceiue how this buſineſſe hangs together, to wit that Sir Humfrey produces the foreſaid homilie againſt tranſubſtantiation, and yet the ſame Sir Humfrey page 98. affirmes that they (I knowe not who) haue in that ſame homilie ſuggeſted tranſubſtantiation by two faigned miracles. Now if in that homilie there be two miracles to proue tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as indeed there bee, howe can it then be truly produced by the knight againſt the ſame? So that here muſt of neceſſitie be ſome iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling in the matter. And more, for my parte I cannot poſſible imagin howe that ould mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie copie of the homilie being in the ſaxon language could make two ſuch monſterous iumpes as firſt to leape out of ould ſaxon in to English, and then out of exiter into Oxon euen iuſte at that preſent time when M. Fox had need of them for the fornishing of his moulie
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2119:78"/> monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Certainelie I hould this for one of the greateſt miracles that anie of the reformed brothers euer committed. Beſides this in my opinion it ſauoures rancke of forgerie to ſay that the wordes razed in the Latin copie of Alfricks Epiſtle to Wolſtan Archbishop of yorke were ſupplied by the ſaxon copie of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as ſome of our aduerſaries doe affirme, not-obſtanding others ſay they had the ſupplie from worceſter. And I demaunde further, whether it is not much more probable that the ſentence which he mentioneth if anie ſuch there were in that Epiſtle, was neuer taken away in the Latin, but rather added by Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius, Oecolampadius, or Bucer, or ſome other greater Doctour of that potatorie Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. More D. Iames ſaith that the Latin E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle ſo razed is intituled: <hi>De conſuetudine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachorum,</hi> and yet the ſame Doctour out of Fox relates it to be againſt the bodilie preſence. <note place="margin">Quibus ſperamus nos qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſdam prodeſſe ad corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem, quamuis ſciamus aliis mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiſſe: ſed non eſt nobis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultum ſemper ſi lere, &amp; non ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quia diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, quia ſi praeco tacet quis Iudicem venturum enuntiet. D. Iames detect. part. 2. pag. 55.</note> Now what connexion the bodilie or vnbodilie preſence of Chriſt in the ſacrament hath with the cuſtome of monks, I am perſuaded that, excepting theſe two great Doctours, all the world beſide can not imagin: Eſpeciallie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that in the wordes related by Iames, there is no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion at all of the bodie of Chriſt, but of correction of ſome certaine perſons. And ſurelie Alfrick being an Abbat himſelfe it is to be iudged farre more proper to him to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2119:79"/> haue writ of things appertaining to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religious perſons, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Euchariſt or tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation, or as they will haue it, againſt the ſame. Finallie Fox referres the tranſlation and publishing of the Homilie and Epiſtles to the yeare 996. Yet Iames affirmes that the Archbishop wolſtan to whome Alfrick writte his Epiſtle concerning that buſineſſe, was a boute the yeare 1054. which yeare differeth much from the other. Wherefore let Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey be aſſured that till he cleares theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties this his new-founde writing caries no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie againſt the Romaniſts. And ſo for concluſion of this matter I ſay that till Sir Humfrey or ſome of his companions can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome authenticall authour before Luther who without their owne gloſſes or illations doth teach plainelie theſe negatiues: Chriſts bodie and bloud are not reallie preſent in the Euchariſt: the bread and wine conſecrated by the Preiſt are not turned into the bodie and bloud of Chriſt by vertue of Gods worde and power, let him not trouble himſelfe and vs with ſuch obſcure new founde fragments as this, with which as being ſubiect to diuers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions he fills his owne head and ours with proclamationes neither diſprouing ouer do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine nor prouing his owne, and onelie giues occaſion of altercation and expenſe of time in vaine aboute the tryall of theſe his queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2119:79"/> and faultie wares. From hence Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey paſſes to the ſecond parte of his Paragraffe, that is to the doctrine of tranſſubſtantiation in theſe wordes. Looke ſaith he vpon their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of tranſſubſtantiation, and you shall ſee how miſerablie their Church is diuided tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the antiquitie and vniuerſalitie of that point of faith. Thus the knight.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer that hauing exactely examined all the particulars which he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for proofe of this his boyſterous affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I finde that as he chargeth moſt falſelie the Romaniſts of diuiſion in the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, ſo his proofe of the ſame by authoritie of the authours which he cytes, is alſo moſt deceitfull, in regard he produces them as if they diſagreed in their faith of the ſoreſayd point, and conſequentlie as if euen according to their owne tenets, they had ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther antiquitie nor vniuerſalitie in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whereas in truth none of the cited au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours haue anie diſagreement among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but all with one vnanimous conſent profeſſedly acknowledge the faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the change of the ſubſtance of bread and wine into the bodie and bloud of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, ſome of them onelie differing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the manner of it. Some houlding it to be ſufficientlie expreſſed in ſcripture, as (vnleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe it be Caietan whoſe meaning I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2119:80"/> in an other place) all ſcholaſticall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines affirme. Some others (among which ſcotus is one, or rather ſcotus alone) being of opinion there is no place of ſcripture ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that without the dermination of the Church it can euidentlie conuince, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine one to admitte tranſubſtantiation in the Sacrament. Others that the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation was held euen in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue Church, tho' perhaps the worde it ſelfe was not vſed in thoſe moſt auncient times but ſince inuented. But not obſtanding what they held in theſe particulars, yet doe none of them which the knigth cites, impugne tran<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or denie that the bread and wine are truelie conuerted into the bodie and bloud of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, but they all expreſſelie auouche, and maintaine it, ſo that a man may maruell where Sir Humfreyes eyes were when he read and rehearſed them.</p>
                     <p>And as for Cardinall Aliaco, he doth not expreſſe his owne opinion in the wordes alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Sir Humfrey, nor yet affirmeth it to haue beene defended by anie authour in his time, but ſaith onelie, <hi>tertia opinio fuit,</hi> the third opinion was. Putting his owne which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>more common,</hi> and more agreeable to the ſcripture and determination of the Church, as alſo to the common opinion of the holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and doctours: onelie graunting that it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2119:80"/> doth not euidentlie follow of the ſcripture that the ſubſtance of the bread doth not remaine after conſecration together with the bodie of Chriſt, or abſolutelie ceaſeth: or, that which I rather conceiue of his true meaning, it can onelie be gathered out of this authour (whome I haue exactelie read in this paſſage) that in times paſt there were ſome fewe who, before the matter was plainelie defined by the Church defended that it is poſſible, yea and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to naturall reaſon, and more eaſie to be conceiued, nor were euidentlie repugnant to ſcripture, that the bodie of Chriſt might remaine with the ſubſtance of bread in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: none of which is contrarie to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of tranſſubſtanciation as it is beleeued actuallie in the Church, nor to the vniuerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of her faith therein, ſuppoſing that an act may conſiſt with poſſibilitie to the contrarie, of which nature it ſelfe yealdes infinitie exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eſpeciallie in ſuch effects as depend vpon indifferent or free cauſes.</p>
                     <p>But not obſtanding this diuiſion of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts which, as the reader may eaſilie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, being onelie in accidentall points of this controuerſie betwixt them and the reformers, maketh nothing for Sir Humfreys purpoſe: yet beſides this the teſtimonies which the knight alledgeth out of the ſame authours are ſo farre from prouing his intent, that there is not one

                     <p>And in the ſame fashion, if not worſe, doth he abuſe Maldonate the Ieſuit affirming that he confeſſeth Saint Auguſtin in the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation to be wholie theirs, citing the foreſaid Maldonat's words vpon the 6. chapter of Saint Iohn. the 5. verſe. For the ſame; which although they be truelie rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the knight, yet haue they no ſuch ſenſe or meaning as he doth either ignorantlie or malitiouſlie ſuppoſe, nor doth he treate in them either of the reall preſence or tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onelie of the expoſition of the wordes of the foreſaid verſe, <hi>Patres vestri manducaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Manna &amp; mortui ſunt, qui manducat hunc panem viuet in aeternum.</hi> Making a queſtion whether in them there be made by Chriſt a compariſon betweene the ſeuerall perſons that did eate, or betwene the ſeuerall kindes of breades which they did eate.

And this being all; yet our learned knight is ſo curious an Alchimiſt that he will needes drawe out of Maldonate by arte, that he confeſſeth S.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2119:82"/> and Cardinall Cuſanus. As if they did teſtifie that there is no antiquitie nor vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallitie in the Fathers touching the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, where as in deede they haue no ſuch matter, as appeereth euen out of the verie ſame wordes which he citeth in this place: Caſtro onelie affirming that there is ſeldome mention of the tranſubſtantiation of the bread into the bodie of Chriſt <hi>in antiquis ſcriptoribus</hi> in the auncient writers, not in the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as the knight doth falſelie tranſlate. And that which is yet much falſer, he tranſlates <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion</hi> for <hi>tranſſubstantiation;</hi> where it is alſo to be noted that Caſtro ſpeakes there onelie of the worde <hi>tranſubſtantiation</hi> not of the thing ſignified by the worde, as is euident by his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wordes which preſentlie fellowe, ſaying thus. <hi>Who but an heretike will dare to denie theſe things becauſe they are not mentioned in auncient Fathers vnder ſuch names?</hi> So that both Caſtros wordes, and ſenſe are groſſelie corrupted by Sir Humfrey. <hi>Valentia</hi> onelie affirmeth that it is not to be marueled, if one or two, or ſome of the auncients (not Fathers as our aduerſarie yet ſomat more corruptedlie then before tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth) before the queſtion of tranſubſtantiotion was throulie debated in the Church, haue tought leſſe conſideratelie, and leſſe weigtilie of this matter.

Cuſanus laſtlie ſaith no more but that certaine of the auncient diuines (if we may giue credit to the knight not heere citing his wordes) are found to be of this minde that the bread in the Sacrament is not tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in nature but ſtill remayneth, and is clothed with another ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce more noble then it ſelfe. In which wordes as you ſee, whatſoeuer thoſe innominated men, and as it ſeemes vnknowne to Cuſanus himſelfe, whatſoeuer I ſay they did hould touching the trueth of tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet certaine it is that they were not Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts in the point of the reall preſence as plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie appeereth by that noble ſubſtance which they held to clothe the bread after conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which doubtleſſe could be nothing els but the moſt pretious and noble bodie of Chriſt which the reformers denie to be preſent in the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>This therefore is all that the cited authours affirme. And to omitte that none of them vſeth the name of Fathers as the knight would haue them, tranſlating and transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2119:83"/> the wordes <hi>ſcriptotes, veteres, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui Theologi,</hi> or the like, into Fathers, or at the leaſt citing the foreſaid authours as if they ſpake planiely of the auncient fathers, which neuertheleſſe their wordes doe not showe, I ſay, to ſay nothing of this which though it is a trick to deceaue the reader, yet it is ſo poore a one as it cannot much aduantage his cauſe. And to admitte that by thoſe formes of ſpeech the foreſaid moderne authours meane the auncient Fathers: yet doth not this argue want of antiquity or vniuerſallity of the Fathers in that pointe, in regard it is not required to the argument of antiquitie that all auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in all ages none excepted agree in the pointe for which that kinde of argument is vſed, eſpeciallie before the matter be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie declared &amp; determined by the Church in caſe of doubt or oppoſition of heretikes or otherwiſe: but onely it is required and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that the moſt parte of them doe conſent therein the reſt not obſtinatelie contradicting the ſame, or carrying themſelues at leaſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent according to the aduiſe of Vincent lyr. <hi>Contra prophanas haereſ. nouit.</hi> ſaying that, <hi>ſi in ipſa vetuſttate diſcrepantes ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tias reperiamus, ſequamur ſententiam plurium &amp; illuſtriorum Doctorum.</hi> That is, <hi>if in antiquitie it ſelfe we fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. different opinions, let vs followe the opinion of the more famous Doctours.</hi> And this is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2119:84"/> true becauſe that if ſuch methaphiſicall antiquitie &amp; vniuerſality were neceſſarie for all points of faith, noe Church in the world could truely be ſaid to haue antiquitie and vniuerſalitie in all points of doctrine or to haue beene alwaies Catholikes, it being a thing manifeſt that not any Church either is, nor was, nor euer will be ſo auncient and vniuerſall as that ail and euery one of the auncient Fathers agree euer actually with her in euery point, as it is moſt cleare in the auncient Father Sainct Cyprian and yet more cleere in Tertullian and origen, who by reaſon of ſome points of doctrine which either were not in their time ſufficiently and expreſſelie determined by the Church, or of which they had, not occaſion to treate may ſeeme in ſome ſorte to diſſent from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church euen in ſuch doctrine as now is knowne, and beleeued for matter of faith euen by the noueliſts themſelues, as appeares in the point of rebaptization defended by S. Cyprian &amp; his adhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in thoſe times. Which if it were not ſo, its euident, that the reformers were yet in farre worſe caſe then either the Romaniſts should be vpon that ſuppoſition, or then now they are, if in worſe they can be imagined to be, whoe neither haue, nor euer can haue any kinde of vniuerſalitie or a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiquity of Fathers either metaphiſicall or morall on
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2119:84"/> their ſide. And now this being all in ſubſtance, are rather more then thoſe three cited authours affirme, it hence appeereth how ſmale reaſon Sir Hum. had to cite them in his fauour, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie conſidering that one of them that is <hi>Alfonſus a Caſtro,</hi> doth onely ſay that there is ſeldome mention made of tranſubſtantiation in the Fathers, not denying as it is manifeſt, their agreement in that point, but rather inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating their conſent therein tho' not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie expreſſed. Furthermore the knigth addeth for the concluſion of this pointe that many writers, and ſchoole men in their owne Church are ſo farre from grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of antiquity &amp; vniuerſalitie to this doctrine, that they profeſſe the tenet of tranſubſtantiation was latelie receaued in the Church for a point of faith. And for this he citeth Scotus as affirming that before the councell of Lateran tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was not beleeued as a point of faith and that the doctrine of it is not verie auncient in the Church. Thus Sir Humfrey.</p>
                     <p>Tho which I anſwer that all tho' Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min affirmes that Scotus ſayde tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not an article of faith before the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Lateran yet I finde he ſpeakes not ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, but at the moſt he ſaith it was not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nly declared as an article of faith before that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, not denying but that it minght be alſo declared in other particular cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels as in deed it

Neuertheleſſe by way of argument I am content to grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the aduerſaries that which Bellarmin affirmes of Scotus: <note place="margin">Et tunc ad tertium, vbi ſtat vis: dicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quod Eccleſia declarauit iſtum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectum eſſe de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate fidei in illo ſimbolo edito ſub In. 3. in Conſilio Later. vbi ponitur veritas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquorum credendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum magis explicite quam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beantur in ſimboloo rum vel Atha. vel Nyceni: &amp; breuiter quicquid ibi dicitur eſſe crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Scot. 4. d. 11. q. 3 in reſp. ad arg.</note> yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this liberall graunt, I doe affirme with all that our Church wanteth neither antiquitie nor vniuerſality either in this or any other point of her doctrine, and the reaſon is becauſe allthough ſome points of her faith were not in all ages and times knowen expreſſelie for arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith, yet were they in themſelues ſuch indeede and for ſuch beleeued with an implicite faith at the leaſt, that is with ſuch a faith as all conteined in the worde of God is belieued by all true Catholikes as an infalible trueth, altho' no one particular were knowne vnto them. For as it is moſt certaine that euery faithfull Chriſtian which cannot reade belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth many things conteined in ſcrpture with be knoweth not, in regard that altho' he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them in particular, yet in that he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all that they include, he allſo belieueth truely euen thoſe particular trueths which he knoweth not: ſo allſo it is certaine that euery faithfull Chriſtian beleeuing vniuerſally all that which the word of God conteines, hath
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2119:85"/> an vniuerſall faith of whatſoeuer points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine either was, is, or shall be declared for matters of faith by the moſt vniuerſall Church in any difference of time, and conſequently he hath as ancient, and vniuerſall a faith of thoſe particular points ſo declared as he hath of thoſe which euen both in the Apoſtles time &amp; in all ſucceding ages were expreſſely knowne for articles of faith to all the Chriſtian world. And let this ſuffice to declare that noe point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine definde by the moſt vniuerſall Church as matter of faith conteined in the worde of God, can truely be tearmed new, but hath as much antiquity and vniuerſality as the greateſt myſterie of the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, &amp; alſo that if any noueltie it hath, it is onely in the declaration of it, <hi>&amp; quoad nos;</hi> that is in reſpect of that new or expreſſe knowledge which we receiue of it by the propoſition of the holy Church. Which infalible manner of arriuing to a new know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of matters of faith, becauſe the ſectaries neither haue it nor admitte it, it neceſſarily followes that whatſoeuer doctrine they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer in theſe later times, muſt of neceſſity want both the foreſaid properties of antiquitie and vniuerſality as we haue declared, in regarde they can not show as much as an implicite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuallie ſucceeding faith in the articles they haue newly broched. Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey further more citeth allſo Hoſtienſis and Gaufridus out of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2119:86"/> Durand. in 4. d. 10. q. 1. n. 23. whoe (as he affirmeth) ſaith there were others in thoſe daies whoe taught that the ſubſtance of bread remaines; and that their opinion was not to be reiected, ſo the knight relateth. But how falſe and corrupted this relation is I know out of Durand himſelfe for that I finde in his 10. d. of the 4. of ſent. q. 1. n. 15. that this paſſage cited by him, is neither Durandes owne doctrine, nor yet theirs whome he cites aboute it, but onely related by them, and taken out of them by Durand to frame his obiection in the begining of his queſtion, as he vſeth to doe, which he afterwardes ſolues in plaine termes ſaying in his 25. number. <hi>Quod ante inducitur de Gloſſatoribus Gaufrido &amp; Hoſtienſe ſuper decreta: dicendum quod licet recitent tres opiniones nullam tamen approbant vt veram niſi illam quod corpus Chriſti ſit in altari per tranſsubſtantiationem panis &amp; vim: &amp; ſi expreſſe non dicunt aliquam aliam erroneam, non propter hoc non eſt erronea, non enim ſciuerunt omnes paſſus ſcripturae à quibus diſcedat opinio ſupra poſita ſicut oſtenſum eſt prius:</hi> And thus the buſines being well examined, I ſay no more but that I ame ſorie the worthy knight should be ſo vnfortunate as to ſtumble vpon the obiection in lue of the doctrine of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelfe. How be it I know it to be a thing ſo incident to the frailty of other of his religion, that I doe not much admire the caſe.</p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:2119:86"/>
                     <p>The ſame Durand is alſoe abuſed by the knight in regarde he produces him to proue that the Roman diuines are diuided in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions touching tranſſubſtantiation, which neuertheleſſe I haue showed by his owne words how plainelie he maintaines it. And that which Bellarmin is here cited to affirme of him lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 13. is not that his opinion is hereticall touching the maine point of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, but onely becauſe by a ſingular opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he houldes that onely the forme of bread and wine, and not the matter is conuerted in to the bodie and bloud of Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which altho' it be falſe, yet doth not the author therfore make anie doubt of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation it ſelfe and ſo this is an other of Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>freyes trickes by which he couſens his reader and iniureth both theſe diuines at once. But put the caſe Durand were truely cyted, yet I ſay as I ſaid before, that a ſmall number of writers againſt the whole torrent of the reſt cannot hinder the antiquitie or vniuerſalitie, either of the doctrine of tranſſubſtantiation, or any other point of faith. And if the antiquitie and vniuerſalitie of Fathers were to be taken in that rigour which Sir Humfrey will haue it, it is manifeſt that he and his conſortes may caſt their cappes at it for any ſuch they should euer be able to finde in their reformed congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it being now euident out of the examen
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2119:87"/> and cenſure of the former ſections, that to ſpeake within compaſſe, they haue not (I doe not ſay the tenth parte in number of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers for the prooſe of the antiquitie and vniuerſalitie of their whole Creede, which the Romaniſts haue for theirs) but not ſo much as one onely authour before Luther, which truely cited and vnderſtood doth defend their doctrine in all and euery particular pointe.</p>
                     <p>And according to this, I anſwer alſo to the teſtimonie of B. Tunſtall whom the kinght citeth as houlding the point of tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to haue bene a matter of indifferencie and not an article of faith within leſſe then fiue hundreth yeeres. To which I replye firſt that Sir Humfrey dealeth heere according to his accuſtomed manner that is inſyncerelie, firſt becauſe he produceth this authours teſtimonie as if he had bene of opinion that perhaps it had bene better to haue left the doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation vndetermined and free for euery one to vſe his owne coniecture, as in his Phanſie it was before the Councell of Lateran; which is moſt falſe for that the Bishop doth onely relate that as an opinion of ſome others which yet he nameth not, his reſolution being in that pointe farre differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as his booke teſtifieth in that ſame place. Secondly he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth inſincerely in that he taketh hould of that onely which maketh for his purpoſe in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2119:87"/> ſome ſort but, leaueth out not onely that which maketh expreſſely againſt him and for the reall preſence (<hi>quaefuit</hi> ſaith Tunſtall <hi>ab initio Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae fides, which was the faith of the Church from the beginning</hi>) but alſo he leaueth out the very reſolution it ſelfe of the authour in this ſame pointe of tranſubſtantiation, where after the wordes by the knight cited, he ſaith expreſſely he houldeth it iuſt for that the Church is a pillar of trueth, that her iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be obſerued as throughly firme. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding further that thoſe who contend that, that manner of tranſubſtantiation ought to be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted (meaning that ſame which the Roman Church both then taught and now teacheth) becauſe the worde is not found in ſcripture, <hi>nimis praefracti iudicij ſeſe eſſe oſtendunt. Quaſi vero</hi> ſaith hee <hi>Christus eo modo illud quod vult efficere non poſſet, cuius omnipotentiae &amp; ſpiritus S. operationi in totum detrahere ſua aſſertione vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur.</hi> By which plaine wordes of this learned Bishop the reader may plainely ſee how dece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iptfullie he is dealt with and how much he is abuſed by the knight. Secondly I anſwer that how indifferent ſoeuer the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation might ſeeme to our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to haue beene before the Councell of Latran, neuerteleſſe both this authour and all others truely Catholikes both ſince and before that councell, haold it not for a matter indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2119:88"/> but for a certaine trueth and verity as appeareth planely by that which hath beene ſaid allready in the declaration and anſwer to thoſe teſtimonies which haue in this paragraffe beene produced for the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly I anſwer that there was neuer ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy in the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church concerning the foreſaid doctrine of tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that ſo manie authours in all ages folowed the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue, that the reformed flock shall neuer be able to show anie for the negatiue, no not one claſſicall authour.</p>
                     <p>He makes vſe alſo of the teſtimonies of the other. <hi>Durand in the fourth of his Rationale chap.</hi> 41. <hi>of Odo in Can. d.</hi> 4. <hi>And Christopher de cap. fontium lib. de correct. Theol. Scholaſt. cap.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp; alib.</hi> who ſeeme to ſay that Chriſt did not conſecrate with thoſe wordes, <hi>this is my bodie:</hi> but by his benediction. But to theſe authours I ſay firſt that whatſoeuer they held in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, they all agree in that point which is here in controuerſie betwixt Sir Humfrey and the Romaniſts, that is they all accorde and teach the reall preſence and tranſubſtantiation, and ſo they are all impertinentlie alledged. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie I ſay, that theſe authours diſpute in the places cited, onelie by what wordes, or action Chriſt himſelfe did conſecrate, and not of the wordes of Conſecration by which the Preiſts vſe to conſecrate: And altho' they propoſe a queſtion of this alſo, yet they agree in that the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2119:88"/> Preiſts doe conſecrate by no other wordes but thoſe. <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> That which in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, at the leaſt, is moſt plainelie expreſſed when in his page 166. he ſaith. <hi>Cum ad prola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem verborum istorum, hoc eſt corpus meum: hic eſt ſanguis meus ſacerdos conficiat de conſecrat. d.</hi> 11. <hi>credibile iudicatur, quod &amp; Chriſtus eadem verba dicendo confecit.</hi> By which wordes it is moſt apparent that durand made no doubt of the determinate wordes by which Preiſts doe conſecrate, nor yet was of opinion that Chriſt himſelfe did vſe anie other, how be it he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome others which thinke that Chriſt did not conſecrate with thoſe ſame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, but he ſaith in the opinion rather of others then himſelfe) that <hi>virtute diuina nobis occulta confecit,</hi> that he did it by diuine virtue or power himſelfe, and afterwardes expreſſed the forme <hi>ſub qua poſteri benedicunt,</hi> by which the ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Preiſts doe bleſſe or conſecrate. Now Sir Humfrey in his citation of this authour lefe out the latter parte of his text which doth plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie declaire his minde to wit the wordes, ſcilicet <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> which durand inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in the benediction or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration of Chriſt, chimericallie ioyning to ſome of the authours former wordes, others which belonge to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion related by durand, which houldes that Chriſt repeated the wordes twiſe firſt to giue them power and vertue of confection or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2119:89"/> conſecration, and afterwardes to teach the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles the forme of conſecration, by which the reader may eaſily perceiue that the knight inſteed of making durand his owne, he both loſt him &amp; his owne reputation by either moſt ignorant or malitious peruerting of that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike authours wordes, and ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>The like to which proceeding he vſeth alſo in the teſtimonie of Odo whome he cites to proue that Chriſts bodie is made in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his benediction, and not by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: <hi>this is my bodie.</hi> For he neither ſincerelie relates, nor trulie conſtrues them. And firſt whereas that authour by may of expoſition of that worde, <hi>benedixit,</hi> ſaith <hi>benedixit, corpus ſuum fecit,</hi> meaning that Chriſt bleſſed the bread, that is to ſay made it is bodie, Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey doth English the wordes both with a falſe interpretation of them and a falſe ſeparation ſo: <note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>and then made that his bodie,</hi> adding the worde <hi>then</hi> of his owne ſtampe. Secondlie he makes a falſe conſtruction of Odos wordes in that whereas Odo vnderſtands by benediction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, as diuers other diuines doe, and as it manifeſtlie appeares by his owne wordes vttered preſentlie after, to wit thoſe which Sir Humfrey cytes, ſaying, <hi>virtute ſermonis Chriſti factum eſt corpus &amp; ſanguis Chriſti:</hi> that is, <hi>by virtue of Chriſts ſpeech the bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt are made:</hi> the ignorant knight imagined that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2119:89"/> becauſe he affirmed before that Chriſt by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction made his bodie, therefore he made it without thoſe wordes <hi>this is my bodie:</hi> which neuertheleſſe are the verie wordes of benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or conſecration which Chriſt himſelfe vſed. True it is Odo ſpeakes ſome thing intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catelie and obſcurelie by reaſon of his breuitie, yet thoſe plaine wordes which followe in the ſame place and matter, <hi>videlicet virtute ſermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Chriſti fiunt corpus &amp; ſanguis Chriſti,</hi> doe ſufficientlie explaine the authours mynde, and ſerue for a cleare expoſition of the reſt, as the iudicious reader of his whole text, will eaſilie perceiue.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the citation of Chriſtopher <hi>De capite fontium</hi> I ſuſpect there is ſome legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vſed in it: becauſe it ſeemes not to me a thing credible that anie man of learning, and iudgement as he is held to be, should be ſo farre out of temper as peremptorilic to conclude for an infallible truth to which ſcriptures, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and all antiquitite yeald an vndeniable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie and conſent that the wordes, <hi>this is my bodie,</hi> are not the wordes of conſecration, how be it the might ſay with the opinion of ſome others that thoſe are not the wordes by which Chriſt himſelfe conſecrated, which point as it is not yet declared by the Church as a matter of faith, ſo neither is it pertinent to the matter we here treat, if ſo it were: as being no
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2119:90"/> denyall of tranſubſtantiation, which onelie is here in queſtion and not the wordes of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. and conſequentlie if that authour (whome I could not haue whereby to examen the truth) if I ſay he ſpeakes in that ſenſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, then his teſtimonie was cyted in vaine. As alſo I may not rashelie auouch that, eſpeciallie if he meanes in the other ſenſe, and as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their rehearſall of our aduerſarie, the wordes doe ſounde. That ſurelie he had taſted of a wrong fountaine when he ſpoake in ſuch an exorbitant manner, if ſo he euer ſpoake.</p>
                     <p>I haue exactelie examined Card. Aliaco, and finde he ſpeakes in thoſe wordes cyted by Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey, onely of the poſſibility of the coexiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or preſence of the ſubſtance of the bread &amp; the bodie of Chriſt vnder the ſame accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which poſſibilitie he affirmes neither to repugne to reaſon nor to the bible, no more then that two quantities or qualities may poſſiblie ſtande to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnder one matter <hi>videlicet de potentia abſoluta,</hi> that is by the abſolute power of God: which is true in regarde that no text of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be found to ſuch contrarie poſſibility, nor implicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in reaſon. But all this how true ſoeuer it is, yet is it out of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ſtate of our queſtion, which is not about the poſſibilitie, but aboute the fact of tranſſubſtantiation, in which point the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this authour is plainelie for vs ſaying
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2119:90"/> that altho' it doth not euidentlie followe of the ſcripture that the ſubſtance of the bread doth abſolutelie ceaſe to be, nor yet, as it ſeemes to me, of the determination of the Church, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe becauſe, ſaith he, it doth more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uore the determination of the Church and the common opinion of the holie Fathers and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, therefore I hould it. And this ſame is that which the Councell of Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t declares: to which doctrine if Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey would conſent as farre as Aliaco, this diſputation were at an end, for that here is nothingels required either of him or any other of his profeſſion but that they obey the authoritie of the Church in her definition.<note place="margin">Seſ. 15 c. 4 Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum hanc viam dico quod pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti ad ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum in deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.

                     <p>In his 111. page the knight proceedes moſt ſophiſticallie in this ſame matter, where, vpon a falſe if, or conditionallie falſe ſuppoſition that neither according to the doctrine of S. Thomas, the Roman Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, and the Maſſe-Preiſts, as he pleaſeth to terme them, the conſecrated bread is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated by Chriſts benediction before thoſe wordes, <hi>this is my bodie,</hi> be vttered, nor by the ſame wordes vttered after benediction, as ſaith he, the Archbishop of Cefarea and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe affirme; he preſentlie thence inferres that abſolutelie there are no wordes at all in the ſcripture to proue tranſubſtantiation for an article of faith: which collection of his neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe is no other then to deduce for conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2119:91"/> of his diſcourſe an abſolute propoſition from a conditionall and this alſo grounded vpon a meere equiuocation: for admit it is true that the foreſaid authours doe not agree whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther determinately tranſubſtantiation be made by the benediction, or by the wordes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, yet they all accorde moſt conſtantlie and conformablie in this, that by one of the two, to wit either by benediction or conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or at the leaſt by both the one and the other, the tranſubſtantiation is vndoubtedlie effected, and conſequentlie they agree vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſlie againſt the poſition of Sir Humfrey, affirming <hi>that there be no words of ſcripture to proue the ſame.</hi> And the trueth is that Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys captious ratiocinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proues no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if two should argue, the one that the colour of the ſea water is greene and the other blewe, &amp; that ſome ignorant Cockes-come should ſtep in and tell them that it followes on their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance in opinion that the Sea water hath no colour at all. Which who ſo euer should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to doe he deſerued to be ſoundlie hiſt at for his audacious follie, &amp; ſo doth Sir Humfrey.</p>
                     <p>And as for Biell whome the knight cites ſaying, <hi>it is not expreſſed in ſcripture how the body of Chriſt is in the Sacrament,</hi> he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thoſe wordes which are quoted by him, tho' not in his 49. as he puts it, but in his 40. lection vpon the Canon: but yet this his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2119:91"/> ſaying is not contrarie to the Romaniſts who eaſilie admit that the manner of the exiſtence or being of Chriſts bodie in the Euchariſt, is neither expreſſedlie declared in the Scripture, nor yet in all ages, and by all authours expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedlie tought in the Church as matter of faith: neuertheleſſe this authour himſelfe in the ſame place addes in plaine wordes, that now that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion which defendes tranſubſtantiation is receiued by all Catholikes, yealding for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſame, becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>we ought to hould of the Sacraments as the holie Roman Church doth hould.</hi> And afterwards he addes. <hi>Wherefore becauſe by the determination of the Church confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the authorities of the holie Fathers we ought to beleeue that the bodie of Chriſt is in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by conuerſion of the bread into it, we are to fee &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the like I ſay of Scotus, &amp; Yribarne his Scholar, who altho' they ſeeme to diminish the antiquitie of tranſubſtantiation, yet their meaning onelie is that it was not in auncient times declaredlie propoſed by Publike autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Church as an article of faith: yet both of them expreſſelie beleeuing and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſame profeſſedlie as a matter of faith. And by occaſion of this, I deſire the reader to take notice that whenſoeuer he findes anie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike authours to ſay that this or that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was not a matter of faith before this or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2119:92"/> that time, their meaning is not that the obiect in it ſelfe was no matter of faith in anie one time ſince it was firſt reueiled by God, either expreſſelie in it ſelfe or as included in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther veritie, but onelie that it was not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelie and generallie knowne, and beleeued for ſuch by all faithfull people, by reaſon it was as then not declared and propoſed publikelie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the Church in anie Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. For that as much as concernes the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in itſelfe, it is no more an article of faith after the definition and declaration of the Church then it was euen before it was ſo defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as may appeare in the conſubſtantialitie of the eternall ſonne with his eternall Father, in the vnitie of perſon in Chriſt and the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of natures and the like: which in them ſelues were reueiled verites and matter of faith euer ſince the newe Teſtament and the lawe of Chriſt was published to the world, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were not declaredlie and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallie knowne for ſuch in a long time after to wit not till the time of the Nicene, Epheſin, &amp; Chalcedon Councels in which they were defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and propoſed for matter of faith againſt the Arian, Neſtorian &amp; Euthycian heretikes. And according to this rule it paſſeth in our caſe of tranſubſtantiation for declaration of which this breefe obſeruation may ſuffice to ſatisfie anie indifferent mynde.</p>

                     <p>Nowe as I ſaid of Scotus and Yribarne, the like I ſay of Caietan cited by the knight out of ſuarez, in his comment. vpon S. Thomas page 108. who altho' in it vpon the firſt art. Of the 15. queſt. he ſaith tranſubſtantiation, which ther he calles conuerſion, is not in the Euangell expreſſelie, <hi>conuerſio non habetur ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitein Euangelio:</hi> and before he ſaith: <hi>we expreſſelie receiued from the Church that which the Goſpell did not explicate.</hi> Yet afterwardes, the ſame authour expreſſelie teaches and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates that thoſe wordes: <hi>this is my bodie:</hi> cauſe both the reall preſence and tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. For thus &amp; addes. <hi>Et perhoc, verbae Chriſti: hoc eſt corpus meum: quia efficiunt vtram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que nouitatem ſcrilicet conuerſionis &amp; continentiae &amp;c.</hi> That is. <hi>And by this, becauſe the wordes of Chriſt: this is my bodie: doe effect both no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties videlicet of the conuerſion, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining.</hi> By which wordes it is manifeſt what this authours meaning was abſolutelie touching the reall preſence, &amp; tranſubſtantiation; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſpoake of the manner in which it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in ſcripture, which is not our queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <p>And in this ſenſe ſpeakes Aliaco when he ſaith, in the place cited by our aduerſarie, <hi>that manner of meaning which ſuppoſeth the ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance of the bread to remaine ſtill a poſsible nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is contrarie to reaſon, nor to the authority of the ſcriptures &amp;c.</hi> For he meaneth onely it is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2119:93"/> not repugnant to anie ſuch expreſſe ſcripture as doth conuince the tranſſubſtantiatton plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely to euerie one, without the authoritie and declaration of the Church and therfore he addeth: <hi>if it could ſtand with the determination of the Church:</hi> in which Aliaco showes ſuch obedience to the Church as Sir Humfrey and his fellowes obſtinately denie vnto her, moſt piouſly captiuating his vnderſtanding euen in that which he held more eaſie, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to reaſon, and ſcripture, according to humaine intelligence and diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>More euer touching the citation of Bishop Fisher <hi>contra cap. Babyl. cap.</hi> 10. His intent in that place, was onely to proue that meerly by the bare wordes of ſcripture without the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionarie interpretation of the Fathers, no certaintie can be had in queſtions of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or matters of faith. And to proue this (which is a direct concluſion againſt Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey and the reſt of our noueliſts) he argueth <hi>exhipoſtheſi,</hi> or vpon ſuppoſition, ſaying that not obſtanding it is true and certaine that our Sauiour by vertue of thoſe wordes: <hi>this is my bodie:</hi> did make his owne bodie really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament: yet if one were obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſtanding preciſelie to the pure text without the interpretation of Fathers, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of the Church, he might denie, that it doth thence followe that in our Maſſe, Preſts
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2119:93"/> make really preſent the bodie of Chriſt. Not meaning to affirme that they doe not in deed (for that the reſt of his booke doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate him to beleeue the reall preſence in Maſſe eſpecially the fourth chapter) but onely inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to declare by examples and reaſons, that it can not be conuinced that Catholike Preſts doe ſo, by pure ſcripture ſecluding the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Doctours of the Church, and her infallible authoritie. And now this being the true ſenſe of B. Fishers diſcourſe: Sir Humfrey verie coningly, by leauing out the precedent, and ſubſequent wordes of the authour, ſo manageth the matter as if he had flatly denied that the reall preſence of the bodie, and bloud of Chriſt, can be proued by anie ſcripture to be made in the Maſſe. And that, this is the true meaning of this authour both the title of his chapter out of which our aduerſarie taketh the wordes he cites, which is this. <hi>Of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of ſcripture by Fathers.</hi> And the whole tenor of his diſcourſe, doe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare, ſo that if the matter comes to ſcanning, the fraude will eaſily appeare with shame enuffe to this our profeſſed aduerſarie of truth. who not content with this, hath alſo like a cheating gramſter to mende his ill game, dropt a carde, I meane the worde <hi>noſtra</hi> which he hath left out in his tranſlation: but this but a pore trick, and ſo let it paſſe. And
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2119:94"/> perhaps it was onely the negligence of the printer. But for the readers better inſtruction I will punctually rehearſe the authors wordes concerning his true meaning, as well thoſe which Sir Humfrey hath omitted for his owne aduantage, as the reſt. Thus he ſaith. <hi>Docea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus quod citra Patrum interpretationem &amp; vſum ab eiſdem nobis traditum, nemo probabit ex ipſis nudis Euangelij verhis ſacerdotum quempiam his temporibus verum Chriſti Corpus, &amp; Sanguinem conſecrare, non quod res haec ambigua fit, ſed quod eius certitudo non tam haheatur ex Euangelij ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis quam ex Patrum interpretatione, &amp; vſu tanti temporis quem illi posteris reliquerunt.</hi> That is <hi>let vs teach that without the interpretation of the Fathers, and the practiſe by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deliuered vnto vs, noman can proue by the bare wordes of the Goſpell them ſelues, that anie man in theſe our times doth conſecrate the true bodie and bloud of Christ, not becauſe this thing is doubtfull, but becauſe the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainetie of it can not be had ſo much by the wordes of the Euangell, as by the interpretation of Fathers, and the practiſe of ſo long time, which they left to poſteritie.</hi> By which wordes it is voyde of all doubt and tergiuerſation, that the authour of them neuer made queſtion but that true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Preſts, as he him ſelfe was, truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate, and make preſent the uerie bodie, and bloud of Chriſt, the contrarie of which our aduerſarie pretendes to proue: onely inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2119:94"/> by this paſage and others to declare againſt his aduerſarie Martin Luther, that ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures alone without the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Fathers and practiſe of the Church, are not ſufficient to conuince the trueth expecially when the wordes are obſcure and ſubiet to diuers ſenſes. And therefore in his page 172. giuing the reaſon of this, he ſaith. <hi>Hoc idcirco dixerim ne quis ipſis Euangelij verbis pertinacius adhaereat ſpreta patrum interpretatione quemadmodum Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therus fecit, vſum, &amp; interpretationem a patribus traditam nihili pendens, &amp; nuditati verborum infistens, quae non ſufficiunt ad id quod velint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincendum. Therefore (quoth B. Fiſtier) I ſaid theſe thinhs leaſt anie one should ouer obstinately adhere to the wordes of the Goſpell themſelues, as Luther did not eſteeming the vſe, and interpretation deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the Fathers, and inſiſting in the nakednes of the wordes, which are not ſufficient to conuince that which they deſire.</hi> And in the inſuing page he concludeth in this manner. <hi>Therefore that is manifeſt which afore we promiſed to sbow, to wit that long continuing cuſtome, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording expoſition of Fathers none diſſenting, doth yeald more ſolid certainetie how anie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure place of the Ghoſpell must be vnderſtood, then the bare wordes; which may be varioufly detorted by contentious people at their pleaſure.</hi> By all which wordes it is more then certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and manifeſt that this authour neuer inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2119:95"/> to show that the reall preſence of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt can not be proued by anie ſcripture to be made in the Maſſe, as our falſe aduerſarie doth endeuore to perſuade his reader: for he onely affirmes that this can not be conuinced by the bare text of ſcripture without the expoſition of Fathers, if anie contenſious perſon should obſtinately denie it, as his wordes aboue cited, euidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
                     <p>And as for thoſe wordes which Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey quoteſt in his margent which in English are theſe. <hi>Neither is there anie worde put there by which the verie preſence of the flesh, and bloud of Chriſt may be proued in our Maſſe:</hi> I ſay that he dealeth not honeſtlie in the recitall of them in regarde he omittes the next wordes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, not obſtanding they belong to te inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of the ſame diſcourſe, and alſo are a plaine explication of the former as the reader of the whole diſcourſe may more clearely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the wordes being theſe. For altho' (ſaith he) Chriſt made his flesh of the bread, and his bloud of rhe wine, it doth not therfore follow by virtue of anie worde here ſet downe, that we as often as we attempt the ſame, doe effect it. In which as the reader may plainely perceiue, the authour abſolutelie affirmeth not that Preiſts doe not effect that which Chriſt effected concerning the reall preſence
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2119:95"/> of his bodie and bloud in the Euchariſt, but onely ſaith <hi>there</hi> (that is among the wordes of the inſtitution of the Sacrament as they are related, by S. Math. and in which thoſe wordes: <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> are not contained) there is not anie worde by virtue of which the ſame can be concluded of Preiſts which is ther affirmed of Chriſt our Sauiour: yet not denying, but expreſſelie auerring that by other wordes of the ſcripture, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie by thoſe wordes rehearſed by S. Luke, and S. Paule: <hi>doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> interpreted according to the expoſition, and practiſe of the auncient Fathers, the making of the reall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrement is firmelie proued, and eſtablished. And hence it is that after he had vttered thoſe wordes which Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey alſo citeth, tho' not intirely; to wit <hi>non poteſt igitur probari, per vllam ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturam,</hi> it can not therfore be proued by anie ſcripture that either laie man or Prieſt, as often at he shall make triall of the buſines, shall in like manner make the bodie and bloud of Chriſt of bread and wine, as he him ſelfe did, ſince that, neither this is contained in the ſcripture: immetiatelie after this I ſay, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionines for concluſion of his diſcourſe, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing clauſe. <hi>By theſe things I thinke no man will be ignorant, that the certaintie of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (the faith of conſecration, as the note in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2119:96"/> his margen doth declare) <hi>doth not ſo much depende vpon the Ghoſpell, as vpon the vſe, and cuſtome, which for the ſpace of ſo manie ages is commended vnto vs by the firſt Fathers themſelues. For it ſeemed to them, the holie Ghoſt teaching, ſo to interpret this parte of the Euangell, and iudged it was ſo to be vſed in their times: that whoſoeuer now would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce, either an other ſenſe, or an other vſe, he should vtterlie reſiſt the holie Ghoſt, by whoſe inſtinct, the former Fathers did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this rite, and ceremonie, in the conſecration of the Eucharist.</hi> Thus plainelie doth Bishop Fisher explicate his owne meaning in that which he had before deliuered ſomat more obſcurelie; ſo that now I doubt not but this will be ſufficient to make the reader capable of the authours true ſenſe, in which I was forced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my ſelfe more then the ſubſtance of the matter required, the more plainelie to diſcouer vnto him the fraude of the aduerfarie both in detorting the ſenſe, and mangling the tenor, or continuation of the text of this moſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and renowned Prelate.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey allegeth S. Thomas <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>par.</hi> q. 75. ar. 7. as alſo the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Catheciſme at randome. as affirming that the ſubſtance of the bread remaines till the laſt worde of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration be vttered. But this is nothing to the preſent purpoſe in reſpect that how long ſouer
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2119:96"/> the ſubſtance of the bread remaines, if at lenght it ceaſeth as they both confeſſe, they both agree with vs Romaniſts and not with the nouelliſts, in the faith of tranſſubſtantiation ſo profeſſedly, that it was more then ordinarie impudencie, and madnes once to mentione them for the contrarie.</p>
                     <p>Now for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d paragraffe of his 9. ſection, Sir Humfrey affirmes in his 115. p. out of Bell: and ſuauez, that manie writers in our Roman Church profeſſe the tenet of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiatien was lately receiued for a point of faith. Which affirmation neuertheleſſe is not iuſtifiable, but falſe, and calumnious to the authours he cyteth for it, videlicet Scotus, Durand, Tunſtal, Oſtienſis, and Gaufridus. Which being all the Romaniſts he either did or could produce (ſuppoſing Eraſmus whome he likewiſe alledgeth, is no Romaniſt in much of his doctrine, in what faith ſoeuer he ended his life, of which, I am not able to iudge) yet none of theſe Romaniſts I ſay euer affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the doctrine of tranſſubſtantiation to be no point of faith, as I haue aboue ſufficiently declared in my anſwer to euerie one of their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies in particular.</p>
                     <p>And touching Bellarmin and ſuarez the one being alledged by our aduerſarie as affirming Scotus to haue ſaid, that the doctrine of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, was not <hi>dogmafidei,</hi> a decree of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2119:97"/> faith before the Councell of Lateran: the other as aduiſing to haue him, and thoſe other ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen corrected, who teach that the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation is not verie auncient. I profeſſe I haue diligentlie read Scotus in this matter, and I ſinde he onelie ſaith, that what ſoeuer is auerred to be beleeued in the Councel of the Lateran <hi>capite firmiter,</hi> is to beheld <hi>de ſubſtantia fidei</hi> as of the ſubſtance of faith after that ſolemne declaration: yet he in no place hath this negatiue: tranſſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was not a point of faith before that Councel, not obſtanding our aduerſaries alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the contrarie out of the Cardinal, who, if he conceiued right of his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, could not iudge Scotus to haue abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telie denyed tranſubſtantiation to haue beene a point of faith in it ſelfe, as Sir Humfrey will haue it: but at the moſt <hi>quoad nos,</hi> or in reſpect of our expreſſe and publike faith of the ſame. For that ſome of Scotus his owne wordes plainelie importe that tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is included in the inſtitution of the Euchariſt, howe be it, it was not explicitly or expreſſelie declared for ſuch in all ages, before the ſolemne declaration, as he termeth it, made in the Generall Councel of Lateran.</p>
                     <p>The wordes of Scotus to this ſenſe and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are theſe. <note place="margin">Scot. d. 11. q. 3. ad ar.</note> 
                        <hi>Non enim in potestate Eccleſiae fuit facere iſtud verum vel non verum, ſed Dei

Et ſecundum intellectum à Deo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum Eccleſia explicauit, directa in hoc vt credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ſpiritu veritatis.</hi> That is. <hi>For it was not in the power of the Church to make this</hi> (the point of tranſſubſtantiation) <hi>true, or not true, but of God the inſtitutour: And according to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding deliuered by God, the Church did explicate it, directed, as it is beleeued, by the ſpirit of trueth.</hi> By which ratiocination or diſcourſe, of Scotus, it is moſt cleare and apparent that the point of tranſſubſtantiation was in it ſelfe a matter of faith euer ſince the Sacrament was inſtituted by Chriſt, in regarde that it being now a point of faith, it muſt of neceſſitie in ſubſtance haue beene ordained for ſuch by God himſelfe, for that it is not in the power of the Church to make, but onelie to declare, and propoſe to beleeuers, the articles of Religion, And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this, I ſay, that ſuarez (ſauing the due reſpect I owe vnto them both) had yet leſſe reaſon then Bellarmin had concerning Scotus: to taxe the ſame Scotus and ſome other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, as if they had tought that the doctrine of tranſſubſtantiation is not verie auncient. For neyther Scotus as his wordes which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated doe teſtifie, nor anie other approued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine of the Roman Church, doe vſe anie ſuch manner of ſpeech, or at the leaſt haue no ſuch ſenſe in their wordes, as euen by all thoſe their ſeuerall paſſages which our aduerſarie could
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2119:98"/> alledge, doth manifeſtlie appeare. How be it ſome of them haue not omitted to ſay, that the worde tranſſubſtantiation hath not beene aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie vſed in the Church, but eyther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by the Fathers of the Lateran Councel, or not long before: or at the moſt, that there haue beene ſome in the world of a contrarie opinion to the trueth of tranſſubſtantiation in itſelfe: which altho' we Romaniſts should graunt to be true; yet doth it not argue anie noueltie in the doctrine, but rather the nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of ſome fewe extrauagant wits, as heretiks or corrigible Catholikes, in oppoſing the ſame, which otherwiſe was generallie main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the reſt of the Orthodox diuines in all ſucceeding ages: the antiquitie of which doctrine, euen thoſe ſame authorities which the ſame Scotus himſelfe profeſſeth to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him out of S. Ambroſe, <note place="margin">Scot. d. 11. queſt. 3. §. qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. ergo.</note> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 11. doe euidentlie conuince, yet further adding that manie others are alledged cap. de conſecrat. and by the maſter in his 10. and 11. diſtinction. Wherefore in my opinion both Bellarmin and ſuarez might much better haue ſpared to paſſe their cenſures in that manner vpon anie Catholike diuines ſuppoſing ſuch reprehenſions ſerue for little or no other vſe, then to aforde our aduerſaries the noueliſts newe occaſion and matter of contention with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eyther neceſſitie or conueniencie, of which
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2119:98"/> the preſent fact of Sir Humfrey lind euen in this place, doth alreadie yealde vs ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place the knight citeth for his tenet Eraſmus but he might haue ſaued the labour for that the Romaniſts hould him abſolutely for none of theirs (as in like manner neither doe they acknowledge wicklif and the waldenſians which neuerteleſſe he was not ashamed to produce for his tenet though onely by waye of omiſſion) howbeit in this particular Eraſmus onely affirmeth that it was late before the Church definde it, which is not contrarie to the certainetie of the doctrine in it ſelfe, but onely a ſuperficiall relation of the time when it was declared expreſſely for a matter of faith or infalible trueth in that nature.</p>
                     <p>And now of this and the reſt of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which haue beene diſcuſſed in this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe which if it had not beene for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the common people which may eaſily be deluded by them I would neuer haue proſecuted ſo largely, as containinge noething worthie of a ſcholers labour: it may I ſay be eaſily collected and perceiued how fondly he concludeth his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as if he had made it appeare that the reformed faith touching the ſpirituall and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall participation of Chriſts bodie, had beene generally beleeued and taugh both in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2119:99"/> the former and later ages, and as if the doctrine of tranſſubſtantiation had noe vnity among the Romish authours, nor vniuerſalitie among the auncient Fathers, nor certainety in the ſcriptures. This I ſay is a moſt impudent vaunt of the bragadocho knight, for that it hath beene already made manifeſt by the ſame teſtimonies which he produceth againſt the Roman doctrine, that not onely the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vniuerſalitie of the ſame in thoſe two points ſtands firme and ſound, but that there is no antiquitie or vniuerſalitie at all to be found in the doctrine of the reformed Churhes in thoſe particulars: to ſay nothing of other points of theit deformed faith, and ſo this shall ſuffice for the cenſure of this paragraffe which as it is larger in wordes then the former ſo deſerueth it a larger ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as conteining noething more but a greater multitude of diuerſe ſorts of ill procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                     <p>The third paragraffe is of priuate Maſſe in which for the honour as I ſuppoſe which he beareth towards the mother Church he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth her definition in the firſt ranke, and then afterwardes the article of his owne Church. The decree of the councell of <hi>Trent. ſeſ.</hi> 22. <hi>can.</hi> 8. is this. <hi>If ame shall ſay that Maſſes in which the Prieſt alone doth communicate are
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2119:99"/> vnlawfull and therefore ought to be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, let him be accurſed,</hi> but the article of the reformed Church will not haue it ſo, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth that priuate Maſſes that is the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Euchariſt by the Prieſt alone with out a competent number of communicants is contrarie to te inſtitution of Chriſt and the practiſe of the primatiue Church. Thus the knight ſetteth downe the matter of diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thus he placeth the two armies in battle aray with their contrarie collours one confronting the other.</p>
                     <p>And this ſpeciall difference I note in them, that the one armie conſiſts of <hi>milites veterani</hi> that is of ould Roman ſouldiers gathered out of the whole Roman Empire and Chriſtian world, the other of fresh men fetched from a corner of the world that is from Ireland. Loe heere the armies ſet in order, now let vs ſee who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away the victorie. You may perceiue by Sir Humfreys relation that the Councell ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with authoritie, it intimateth thoſe aged Synods of the primatiue Church, it doth ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate that it maketh the reformed brothers tremble to heere it. Naye it ſeemes it ſo daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the valiant knight that he found no other refuge then to flie to Irela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for an article of his faith. A man would rather haue expected that to confront the Councell of Trent and it defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2119:100"/> Sir Humfrey would haue had recourſe to the Councell of Gapp. or of Dort, or to ſome conſiſtorie aſſemblie of Geneua, or to an Acte of an English Parleament. But alas the poore Caualier found ſo small hope of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in theſe, that he was conſtrained to ſaile to Ireland for an Irish article as he himſelfe doth tearme it. True it is the Irish article di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlie oppoſeth the definition of the Councell, but by what authority I know not, yet certaine it is that in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Trent there were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by themſelues or their legates, or at the leaſt conuented, all the Princes both of the ould and newe Religion, and Prelates of the Chriſtian world, as the Bull of indiction, and the oration had in the laſt ſeſſion moſt plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie teſtifie. And ſo the authoritie of this Synod euen in common ſenſe muſt needes be verie great: but the authoritie of the articles which our knight oppoſeth to the Councell, what authoritie they had, is yet vnknowne: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they poſſible haue anie authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of greate moment, for that they were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered onelie out of a verie small corner of the Chriſtian world, and farre inferiour in vertue, learning, and other naturall parts to the moſt greate, graue and venerable number of the members of the foreſaid Synod. Wherefore let the indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reader iudge whether of theſe two armies is to be followed. The authours of the article proteſt that priuate Maſſe is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2119:100"/> to the inſtitution of Chriſt and the practice of the Church, and hence the knight inferreth that it is vnlawfull and therefore to be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and farther that the Councell of Trent by curſing thoſe who hould that maſſes in which the Prieſt alone doth comunicate are vnlawfull and ought to be abrogated, doth curſſe Chriſt that ordeined it and God that commaunded vs to obſerue it. Heere you ſee the knight tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with as greate authoritie as if he were the greateſt graduate, either in Oxford or Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, neuertheleſſe he muſt giue him leaue who is no graduate to let him knowe that he fayleth mightilie in his colection, yet not ſo much in the gradation it ſelfe as in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which being either falſe or at the leaſt aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocall, the concluſion muſt of neceſſitie be faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. That which deceiued him is his Irish ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith in that it affirmeth the receiuing of the Euchariſt without a competent number of comunicants, is contrarie to the inſtitution of Chriſt. For though it is true that when Chriſt inſtituted the Sacrament, he did actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie comunicate thoſe that were preſent, yet it is not true that he included in the inſtitution of it that iuſt ſo in all occaſions it should be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, neither gaue he anie negatiue precept the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein in that reſpect, but onelie an affirmatiue which according to it nature, not allwayes but onelie according to time, place, and perſons,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2119:101"/> obledgeth. So that the diſtribution is neither anie eſſentiall parte of the Sacrament, nor yet anie neceſſarie propertie of it to be in all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions exerciſed, but rather appertaineth onelie to the due adminiſtration of it according to the foreſaid circumſtances: and heerein conſiſts the aequiuocation of the firſt article.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the ſecond part which affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the receiuing of the Prieſts alone is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the practice of the primatiue church, is alſo equiuocall, for if it meanes that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue Church did in all circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of time, place, and perſons, practice the ſame either by virtue of Chriſts inſtitution or commaund, ſo it is falſe as we haue alreadie showed: but if it meanes onely that indeede ſo it was practized in the primatiue Church either alwaies, or for the moſte parte, yet not as a thing alſolutely neceſſarie either by virtue of Chriſts inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or precept, ſo we cannot deny but that it is true which the ſecond parte of the article affirmeth, but then this being a matter in this ſenſe either of indifferencie or at the moſt of greater merit and perfection, it might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be altered by an introduction of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie cuſtome or practiſe of the Church, eſpecially the communicating or not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of the auditours of euerie Maſſe being a thing wholelie depending vpon the deuotion of the people themſelues. Which deuotion
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2119:101"/> although the Church could haue deſired it had continued in the ſame feruour in which it was in thoſe primitiue times, neuertheleſſe ther was no reaſon why either she should obledge the people to the ſame, or yet that the Preiſt for want of deuotion in the people, should omitte his owne, and ceaſe to exerciſe ſo high and profitable a function to the members of the whole Church as is the publique liturgie and common praier of the ſame. And truelie this is a matter ſo conformable to reaſon and pietie that if it were not that our aduerſaries are quite poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction they would neuer contend ſo much aboute it as they doe, Eſpecially ſuppoſing that of all points of controuerſie betweene them and vs that is of the leaſt moment, and a thing for which they haue the ſmaleſt reaſon to ſtriue as well becauſe they themſelues reiect all ſorts of Maſſes as vaine and ſuperſtitious whether they be priuate or publique, with communion of the people or without: as alſo becauſe euen they themſelues after their newe manner cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate their owne liturgie as they call it, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times yea moſt ordinarily not onely without the comunion of the people, but euen with out the comunion of either Prieſt or clarke, as is euident by the moſt common practiſe of all the reformed Churches, which onely with a drie fothering paſſe the greater part of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2119:102"/> su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>daies of the whole yeere. And yet theſe ſame Zealous brothers are ſo Croſſe in their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge that they are not ashamed to reprehend in vs the ſame which they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ordinarily practiſe in a much worſe manner. In regard of which prepoſterous dealing of theirs in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we may not vnaptlie applie vnto them the ſaying of a certaine ingenious Proteſtant in his deſcription of a Puritan, to wit that they are become ſo croſſe in their teaching, that he thinkes verily, that if the Roman Church should inioyne the puting on of cleane shirts euery ſunday, rather then obey her precept, they would goe lowſie.<note place="margin">Ouerb.

And touching the foreſaid citation out of the Euangeliſts, it is to be noted that becauſe Sir Hum. will not haue his reader heare of the conſecration of the Sacrament which the reformers neuer vſe, in their Churches, therfore he left out the wordes, <hi>and he bleſſed it,</hi> puting onely the wordes of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes giuing, whereas yet the Greeke <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The knight alſo citeth a place of S. Paule 1. Cor. 11. But the Apoſtle indeed reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth there the fault of the richer Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians in that they did exclude or at the leaſt not expect the poorer ſorte to eate the vſuall ſupper with them, when they met to gether to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2119:103"/> receiue the bleſſed Sacrament, but giueth no precept to them that all that are preſent should euerie time they did meete in the Church actually receiue the communion, with the Preiſt: or that the Preiſt ougth not in anie caſe to celebrate without a competent number of communicants, which is our queſtion in this place: but at the moſt S. Paule there ordaines that when the people comes together to eate either the vſuall and common ſupper, or the bodie and bloude of Chriſt in the Sacrament, they vncharitablie exclude not or preuent one an other, but expect, and doe it with order and ſobrietie, and like brethren together, without ſciſme or ſeparation: and as Chriſt himſelfe did who imparted his ſupper moſt louinglie to his diſciples there preſent without exception of perſons: to which altho' I admit the ſame S. Paule in parte alludes in his firſt verſe of this chapter; ſaying: <hi>be you followers of me as I alſo of Christ,</hi> yet not in that ſenſe as if he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded the Corinthians that our Sauiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the Euchariſt should neuer be celebrated by the Preiſt alone with our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, as our aduerſarie foundlie infers for profe of the article he oppoſeth to the Councell of Trent. Neyther is the doctrine of that article in anie ſorte fauoured by S. Auguſtin in his 118. Epiſtle cited by Sir Humfrey: he onelie there affirming at the moſt that the Apoſtle
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2119:103"/> ſpeaketh of the Euchariſt, when he ſaith thoſe wordes: <hi>Propter quod fratres cum conuenitis ad manducandum inuicem expectate. &amp;c.</hi> That is in English: Therefore my brethren, when you come to eate, expect one an other &amp;c. Which wordes eyther of S. Auguſtin, or thoſe of the Apoſtle, are not contrarie to the celebration of priuate Maſſes except it be in the imagination of the Nouelliſts, as I haue ſufficientlie aboue declared: To omit that the greater parte of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines both auncient &amp; moderne, expounde not thoſe wordes of S. Paule rather of the Euchariſt but of the common ſupper, the trueth of which expoſition the text itſelfe, in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, doth plainely conuince. Yet not to ſtand vpon this it is ſufficient for the defence of the doctrine of the Councell of Trent, in this particular and confutation of the contrarie poſition, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the cited place of S. Paule, nor in anie other place of ſcripture, priuate communion, or receiuing of the Preiſt alone without other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, is affirmed to be repugnant to Chriſts inſtitution: nor condemned as vnlawfull eyther by Sainct Auguſtin or anie other Orthodox writer.</p>
                     <p>But yet I muſt further aduertiſe the reader that I perceiue Sir Humfrey hath not dealte ſo faithfully as he ought to haue, in his recitall of S. Paules wordes, putting in by parentheſis and in the ſame letter thoſe <hi>(to eate the lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)</hi>
                        <pb n="212" facs="tcp:2119:104"/> which wordes neuertheleſſe S. Paule hath not, at the leaſt in that place, and then omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt wordes of the next verſe he connecteth them with the latter parte of the ſame verſe, to wit: <hi>that you come not together to iudgement.</hi> Procuring by this fraude to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade his reader that thoſe wordes containe the penaltie due to thoſe whoe communicate not with the Preiſt and the reſt of the people which directly they doe not, but rather the punishment amenaced by the Apoſtle to ſuch as by excluding vncharitably ther fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes from participation of the oblations, or common ſupper then vſed in the Church, and by other abuſes and ſinnes mentioned in this Epiſtle, indignelie receiue the bodie, &amp; bloud of Chriſt in the Euchariſt.</p>
                     <p>And yet not to ſtand vpon theſe particular circumſtances, certaine, it is that none of them could yeald anie warrant at all for Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey to alter the tenour of the Apoſtles wordes either by addition, or tranſpoſition of them.</p>
                     <p>Sir Humfrey addeth alſo that Sainct Paule 1. Cor. 10. calleth the Euchariſt the communion. But he might haue ſaued labour in citing ſcripture, the commonly receiued phraſe both by vs and them being ſufficient to prooue that. And yet he might much better haue ſpared the interpretation of the worde it
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2119:104"/> ſelfe for whether his etimology be true or falſe, which I will not ſtand to examen, certaine it is that no iudicious man can thence inferre that all the people preſent at Maſſe muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity communicate, but it onely foloweth that when they actually receiue the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they receiue the Communion as a common vnion not onely of Preiſt &amp; people but alſo and ceefly of the people among themſelues, according to the wordes of the ſame Apoſtle in his next chapter and 33. verſe <hi>cum conuenitis, when you come together to eate expect one-another &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And much like as he did proceede in the former place of S. Paule, ſo doth he in this: <hi>The cup of bleſsing which we bleſſe, is it not the communion of the bloud of Chriſt?</hi> Where for, <hi>communication</hi> he puts <hi>communion.</hi> And yet the ſcope and ſenſe of the Apoſtle in this place is not of the communion of Preiſt and people, nor preſcribes he anie rule in that nature, but onelie reprehendes thoſe who voluntarily and without ignorance eate idolothytes or meates ſacrifyced to Idols, ſaying that as thoſe who receiue the bodie and bloud of Chriſt comuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or are ioyned in ſocietie with him: ſo they who of knowledge eate things offered to Idols are made companions of the deuill. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore the ſame Apoſtle in the latter parte of his 20. verſe ſaith thus. <hi>And I will not haue you become fellowes to deuils.</hi> And preſentlie in the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2119:105"/> next verſe he addes: <hi>You can not drinke the chalis of our Lord, and the chalis of deuils.</hi> So that the whole tenour of the chapter afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not a worde or letter for Sir Humfreyes purpoſe. Wherefore let him examen his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience diligentlie, and he will eaſilie finde that neyther the one place nor the other proue anie thing elſe in this matter then his owne dishoneſt dealing, and his abuſe of the ſacred text of ſcripture. Eſpeciallie conſidering that in the firſt place, the Apoſtle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendes not the Corinthians ſo much becauſe they did not communicate together, but cheefelie becauſe the rich did vnchriſtianlie exclude the poore. Which caſe as the reader may eaſilie perceiue, hath no place in the Maſſes of the Roman Church, where none are excluded but rather expreſſelie exhorted vnto the communion, as the verie ſame decree of the Tridentine Councel which our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie him produces, doth ſufficientlie declare in theſe wordes. <hi>Optaret quidem ſacroſancta Synodus &amp;c. The Sacroſaint Synod could wish that the faithfull people which aſsiſte at euerie maſſe would communicate with the Preiſt, not onelie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallie, but alſo by Sacramentall reception.</hi> Thus the Councel. Which wordes alone doubtleſſe were ſufficient not onelie to iuſtifie the practiſe of the preſent Roman Church in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but alſo to ſatisfie the aduerſe parte, if their
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2119:105"/> importunitie were not ſo exobbitant, that they will rather ſuffer pore Chriſtians to paſſe out of the world without that diuine <hi>viaticum</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God for the confort of their ſoules, &amp; defenſe againſt their enimies in that da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous trance, then ſuffer them to receiue it without a competent number as they tearme it: which impious order of theirs may be ſeene in their booke of common prayer title <hi>of the communion of the ſicke:</hi> not obſtanding our Sauiours moſt ſtrict, and generall charge affirming that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we eate his flesh, and drinke his bloud, we cannot haue life in vs. But certaine it is that in this as is in other matters the pretenſiue reformers may ritelie be compared to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, <hi>exolantes culicem, camelum autem glucien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> I who ſtraine a gnat, and ſwallowe a camel, in that they ſtande ſo peremptorilie vpon the communion of the people with the Preiſt in all occaſions which is but a circumſtance of the precept: and yet make no ſcruple of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the precept itſelfe euen in time of it grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt neceſſitie and obligation. But this I ſpeake onelie vpon ſuppoſition their communion were ſounde and according to Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for taking it as it is, the want of it is no loſſe to the not receiuers of it: and ſo I leaue them to the generall liberty they vſurpe as well in this as in other matters of Religion, and auncient practiſe of the Church.</p>

                     <p>Laſtlie Sir Humfrey alledgeth the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of diuerſe Romaniſts which hee calleth the confeſſion of his aduerſaries, that priuate Maſſe was altogether vnknowne to the primatiue Church. But I anſwer that when the knight cited thoſe authours he ought to haue remembred what hee was to proue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Irish article which he vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to defend and according to his owne poſition viz. That priuate Maſſe is contrarie to Chriſts inſtitution, and vnlawfull, and to be abrogated. This then he ought to haue proued if he ment to proue anie thing againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doctrine. But in ſteede of this which he will neuer be able to proue, he proueth at the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2119:106"/> moſt by the foreſaid teſtimonies, onelie that which the Romaniſts, doe not denie, to wit that the primatiue Church did practice the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Euchariſt to thoſe that were preſent, but he proueth not that either that Church did ſoe in all occaſions, nor that she held it neceſſarie by virtue of anie lawe, or inſtitution of Chriſt, and ſo he laboureth in vaine as well in this as he hath done in other proofes often times before. Neither is this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent point of Controuerſie betwene vs and the reformers about the auncient cuſtome of the primatiue Church concerning the communion of the people preſent at the Liturgie, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is contrarie to Chriſts inſtitution or commaunde to celebrate priuate maſſes? the affirmatiue of which queſtion excepting Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander (whome I haue alreadie aduertiſed the reader to be no Romaniſt) nay nor yet Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelfe nor anie one of the cited teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies doth proue. Nay there is not one worde in anie of the places cited touching anie ſuch doctrine or precept of the Primatiue Church but onelie mention is made of the fact of auncient Chriſtians in that particular, with an addition of their owne verdit as houlding it for more profitable to the receiuers to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate at euerie Maſſe, if their deuotion were ſo much extended as in thoſe more feruorous times of the primatiue ſpirit it appeeres to haue
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2119:107"/> bene. And although not onelie all or moſt of the authours rehearſed, but alſo the Councell of Trent itſelfe doth hould the foreſaid practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the auncient Church to be more fruitefull for the Laytie then the cuſtome of more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne ages: yet doth Sir Humfrey moſt abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delie hence inferre either the noueltie of the Roman doctrine, or the antiquitie of his owne. For that as we haue showed alreadie neither in anie of the cited authours nor in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent it ſelfe, as their wordes doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is there anie mention of doctrine or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Primatiue Church but onelie of her fact and practice, from whence alſo may moſt eaſilie appeere the greate impertinencie of a further illation which the knight doth make concluding the greater fruitfulnes of his owne communion then of ours, whereas indeede his being no true communion at all, as not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that which according to the inſtitution of Chriſt ought truelie and reallie to be in it, and ſo communicated truelie and reallie to the people, and not by figure and faith onelie, I meane the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, certaine it is that no ſuch inference can be made out of anie compariſon made betwene the Catholike communion and his owne, in regard there is no true paritie or ſimilitude to be founde in them: and moreouer it is ſo farre from being confeſſed by the cited authours that the communion of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2119:107"/> the reformers is more fruitfull then their owne, that they teach expreſſelie that according to the doctrine of the reformed Churches tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reall preſence, the receiuers of their Sacrament can receiue no fruite at all. And now let this ſuffice for anſer to thoſe authours <hi>In generall:</hi> Yet becauſe it may be my aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie will not be ſatisfied with this generall anſer alone, as alſo becauſe I finde he hath vſed not a little of his vſuall proceeding in want of fidelitie in the citation of the authours, I ame content to deſcend to particulars, and examen them in order. The firſt the knight cites, is Cochlaeus out of Caſſander, but neither he nor Caſſander haue anie thing in that place againſt priuate Maſſe, but onelie teſtifie what the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the auncient Church was, which, as I haue alreadie declared, is impertinent to this purpoſe. Beſides Sir Humfrey tranſlates Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chleus wordes corruptedlie, for he doth not ſay that the holie Goſte hath thought vs a remedie againſt the ſlouthfulnes of the Preiſts in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating of priuate Maſſe, but he ſaith, <hi>the holie Ghoſt hath inuented and introduced a pious ſupplie of this negligence by the frequentation of ſuch Maſses as Preiſts celebrate alone.</hi> So by inuerting the wordes, the malitious knight impoſeth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Preiſts onely for a faulte that which Cochleus calles a remedie prouided by the holie Goſt to ſupplie the faulte of the leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2119:108"/> ſorte of people as well as the defect of the Preiſts. Which defect neuertheleſſe Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleus placeth not in their ſlouthfulneſſe in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating priuate Maſſes: but in not exhorting the laytie to communicate at euerie Maſſe, as his wordes ſufficiently declare.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place he cites Durand myma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis who as ſpeaking onelie of the cuſtome of the auncient Church and conſequentlie not againſt the Romaniſts, yet he corruptes him both in that for <hi>Domino dicente,</hi> he tranſlates; <hi>according to Chriſts commaunde:</hi> as alſo by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out his inſuing wordes which declare the reaſon of the alteration of that auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. <hi>Sed excreſcente fidelium multitudine tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur inſtitutum vt tantum Dominicis diebus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municarent.</hi>

                     <p>For Caſſanders authoritie we do not care. And yet I can not finde in Mycrologus thoſe wordes which Caſſander and Sir Humfrey al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge out of him, to wit, <hi>it can not properlie be called a communion except ſome beſides the Preist doe communicate.</hi> How be it the ſame Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the ſame place doth not condemne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Maſſes for a Sacrilegious action, or to be
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2119:109"/> prohibited, as Sir Humfrey and the reſt of the Nouelliſts commonlie maintaine: But onelie playing the parte of a Pacifyer, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, perſuades that the auncient cuſtome may be reſtored. Nay and he addes further and that truelie, that the Preiſts ſay when they celebrate priuatelie, they doe not participate of the Sacrament in their owne priuate name, but in the name of the Church and people: which doubtleſſe in reaſon is ſufficient to make it a true communion, if otherwiſe it were not. And as for Mycrologus, certaine it is that he is no condemner of priuate Maſſe, how ſoeuer he might eſteeme that communion leſſe proper, according to the Etymon of the worde, <note place="margin">Vid. Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander. pag. 998.</note> in which more then one doe not actuallie receiue, which is all he intendes, if anie ſuch ſaying he hath, which notwithſtanding is not contrarie to the doctrine or practiſe of the Romaniſts. <hi>Innocentius tertius</hi> onelie explicates the ancient cuſtome of the Church touching the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the people at euetie Maſſe, and the change of it at ſeuarall times and by degrees. And ſurelie if we conſider that the Noueliſts hould this Pope for one of their greateſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites in doctrine, it were madneſſes to imagin that he should in anie ſorte fauoure their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. And becauſe I reflected that Innocentius as being a Pope had no reaſon to finde anie greater fauour at Sir Humfreys hands then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2119:109"/> Romaniſts haue founde, vpon vewe of the place I diſcouered that he had falſelie tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome parte of Innocentius wordes, which make againſt him to wit, for theſe wordes: <hi>quia nec hoc digne potuit obſeruari,</hi> he tranſlates: by reaſon this cuſtome was neglected, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas he should haue put in English: <hi>Becauſe neither this could be dignely, or with due reuerence obſerued:</hi> By which falſe tranſlation he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertes the true cauſe of the altetation of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſaid cuſtome.</p>
                     <p>Hoffmeiſterus onelie declares the publicitie of the auncient cuſtome with a deſire that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours may be vſed for the reſtitution of it, with whome we Romaniſts all ioyne to our power; ſo this is out of the compaſſe of our queſtion. The allegation of Doctour Harding who ſpeakes much to the ſame purpoſe, I haue anſered in an other place and showed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of the relatour, altho' in this place I finde he rehearſes his wordes truelie, by reaſon it had auailed him nothing to haue here abuſed him.</p>
                     <p>Iuſtinian makes no mention of either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate or publike Maſſes but onelie of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of one conſecrated bread or loafe to ſignifie more expreſſelie the vnion of charitie, which is not to this purpoſe: as neither is the place of Bellarmin following lib. 2. de miſſa cap. 9. as afterwardes I will declare.</p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:2119:110"/>
                     <p>But to returne to Doctour Harding, it is true I find Sir Humfrey cytes him towardes the end of the ſame paragraffe out of Iewell, which altho' he makes nothing for the proofe of his intent in this place, but is onelie brought in vpon the by to enlarge and fournish his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as I ſuppoſe, yet doth he abuſe that learned diuine in that he leaueth out one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reaſon which he alledges why the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Catholikes vſed to communicate euerie day with the Preiſt, becauſe, ſayth he, they looking hourelie to be catched &amp; put to death by the Panimes (I relate the ſenſe not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall wordes) should not departe without the <hi>viaticum.</hi> Which wordes being the verie harte of the authours ſentence, Sir Humfrey verie ſlylie omits it, as if it were not to the purpoſe, and by that meanes he moſt deformedlie cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the head and the heeles together, which corruption altho' it doth not much auaile him, yet it ſeemes he makes a recreation of that arte, and ſo he will rather playe ſmale game then ſit out.</p>
                     <p>Laſtelie the wordes of Iuſtinian taken out of his Commentarie vpon 1. Cor 10. are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, for he does not affirme that the Communion directlie was giuen to all that were preſent, as his wordes cited by the knight doe teſtifie, which authour being the laſte which he cites, and no more to his purpoſe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2119:110"/> then the reſt, let this ſuffice for the cenſure of the contents of this whole paragraffe, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie for the confutation of that aſperſion of Noueltie, and corruption with the knight doth indeuore calumniouſlie to caſt vpon the Roman Creede, it nowe being plainelie cleered and iuſtified by that which hath beene ſaid, and he himſelfe conuinced of falſe dealing and forgerie.</p>
                     <p>The paragraffe inſueing is of the ſeuen Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And to be plaine with Sir Humfrey, I ſay that in the verie entrance of his treatie he telleth a plaine lie to his reader, affirming the Romaniſts to relie wholie vpon the Councell of Trent in this pointe. For this Councell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſelie hath in the margent of the decree of the ſeptenarie number of Sacraments, the Councell of Florence, and in the decrees of euerie ſeuerall Sacrament there is reference to ſcriptures, Councels and Fathers, as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines doe teſtifie. Wherefore thus the knight beginneth, and how he will proceed I know not, but yet for the moſt parte an ill beginning makes an ill ending.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he reprehendeth Bellarmin for ſaying that the authoritie of the Councell of Trent if there were no other ought to ſuffice for proofe of the ſeptinarie number of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But he might with farre greater reaſon haue reprehend both his owne temeritie and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2119:111"/> the preſumption of the reformed Churches. Which without anie ſuch authoritie as the Councell of Trent hath, doe denie the foreſaid number of Sacraments. Beſides that Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins meaning is not that the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Trent hath ſufficient authoritie to define the ſame without foundation of the worde of God, or without ſcripture as it ſeemes Sir Humfrey fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelie ſuppoſeth, but that ſuppoſing ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, it hath infallible power to declare the ſame as conformeable to trueth &amp; to the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctrine and practiſe of the Church in former ages, and conſequentlie as a matter of faith. And certainelie that Church which hath not this authoritie is no true Church nor ſuch an one as is deſcribed in the ſcriptures, but a meere conuenticle or Sciſmaticall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation vnſuteable to the worde of God. And whereas it ſeemes ſtraunge to Sir Humfrey that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Bellarmine, one teſtimonie of a late Councell might ſuffice for the eſtablishing of an article of faith for that by his owne <hi>tenet</hi> ſuch an article requires both antiquitie, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſalitie and conſent: let him but truelie and ſincerelie conſider what Bellarmines meaning is, and he will preſentlie ceaſe to maruell at his poſition. He muſt therefore know that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas Bellarmin affirmeth that the Councell of Trent alone might bee ſufficient to declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole Church as an infallible trueth
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2119:111"/> that the number of Sacraments properlie and truelie ſo called is no more nor leſſe then ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, his meaning is that becauſe the foreſaid Councell is of as greate authoritie as other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councells euer haue had in times paſt, it ought to haue the ſame credit in the preſent Church touching thoſe points which it hath defined, that they had in the Church of their times in ſuch matters as they then defined, and conſequentlie that as thoſe points of doctrine which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they had beene doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before, were neuertheleſſe by the ſame Councels determined as certaine and infallible doctrine of faith without anie defect of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie vniuerſalitie, or conſent, &amp; in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as all the whole Chriſtian world was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnder paine of damnation to beleeue it, as is manifeſt in the conſubſtantiallitie of the ſecond perſon definde in the Councell of Nice, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie of the third perſon in the firſt Councell of Conſtantinople, the vnitie of the perſon of Chriſt in the Epheſin, and the duplicitie or diſtinction of his natures in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Calcedon, as alſo the duplicitie or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of his wills in the ſixt Councell cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at Conſtantinople: ſo in like manner ought the preſent Church to doe with the Councell of Trent in all it definitions, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie in the definition of the number of the ſeuen Sacraments, which definition ought to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2119:112"/> be held for certaine as well as the former deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the foreſaid Councels, both in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it was decreed by the authoritie of the ſame ſucceeding Church by which thoſe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions were made, as alſo in regard it hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, vniuerſalitie, and conſent, both in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is deduced from the ſcriptures by infallible authoritie, and alſo for that we doe not finde anie either of the auncient Fathers, or moderne diuines to haue denied the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be ſeuen in number, or affirmed them to be onelie two as the reformers commonlie teach.</p>
                     <p>Now for the ſecond reprehenſion which Sir Humfrey maketh of Bellarmin for ſaying, that if we take away the credit of the preſent Church and preſent Councell of Trent, the decrees of all other Councels, nay euen Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith it ſelfe might be called in queſtion: this reprehenſion I ſay is as friuolous as the former, for that according to both Bellarmines ſuppoſition and the trueth itſelfe, the preſent Roman Church and Councell of Trent, being of the ſame authoritie, as I haue aboue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with the Church and Councels of more auncient times, and alſo it being euident that as in thoſe daies diuerſe points of doctrine haue bene called in queſtion by the heretikes of thoſe times, ſo they might at this preſent be brought againe in doubt by others, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2119:112"/> itſelfe hath taught vs both euen in thoſe ſame matters which in former times haue bene definde, as appeereth by the hereſie of the new Trinitarians, and others: as alſo in other truethes which as yet were euer held in the Church for certaine, all this I ſay being moſt apparantlie true and out of all manner of doubt among the learned ſorte of people; doubtleſſe if, as Bellarmine ſaith, we take awaie the credit of the preſent Church and preſent Councell of Trent, or others which heereafter may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, there will be no power lefte whereby to ſuppreſſe ſuch new oppinions, and errours, as by heretikes in diuers times and occaſions may be broached contrarie to the Chriſtian faith as well concerning matters alreadie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in former Councells, as alſo touching ſuch new doctrine as may hereafter be inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by other ſectaries, of which we haue too much experience in the Nouelliſts of theſe our dayes who call in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuers points defined in former Synods, of which we haue inſtances in the doctrine of the diſtinction of the diuine perſons queſtioned by the new Trinitarians, of the doctrine aboute the lawfull vſe and honour of images defined in the 7. Generall Councell the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Lateran. The number of the Sacraments and the like reiected euen by Sir Humfrey him ſelfe and his fellowes: and conſequentlie that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2119:113"/> which Bellarmine affirmeth in this ſenſe is moſt plaine and certaine and ſo farre from Atheiſme, as the contrarie is from trueth it ſelfe. And if Bellarmine be reprehenſible for equalizing the preſent Church and Councells with thoſe of auncient times, ſuerlie the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers themſelues are farre more faultie and guiltie in this kinde, for that they doe not equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize but alſo preferre the authoritie of their owne preſent Congregations and Parleaments before the Church and Councells of farre more auncient times then is the date of their doctrine and religion. And this they doe not onelie in theſe points of doctrine which the later Councells haue determined againſt the later errours of Sectaries, as the knight doth odiouſlie ſugieſt, but alſo in ſome articles of moſt auncient faith and doctrine, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtlie apparant in the pointe of the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente, iuſtification, and the like.</p>
                     <p>And as for the reaſon which Sir Humfrey yeeldeth againſt the authoritie of the preſent Church, alledging that the worde of Chriſt is alone ſufficient for the faith of all beleeuing Chriſtians; this reaſon I ſay is of no force, it is but an ould ſong of the Puritans which hath beene a thouſand times repeated by the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and as oſten refuted by the Romaniſts. And who denyes but that the worde of God certainelie knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſuch, &amp; truely interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2119:113"/> and declared, is ſufficient for the faith of all Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? but to this who doth not alſo knowe that the authoritie of the Church is neceſſarie in all times and places? nay whoe doth not ſee that the one of neceſſaritie and as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically inuolueth the other, and that in ſuch ſorte that the ſectaries by excluding the infalible authouritie of the preſent Church from the ſufficientie of the ſcrpitures doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe then deny that parte of the ſcripture which commendeth vnto vs the conſtant and perpetually ſucceſſiue authority of the Church till the confommation of the worlde. And if Sir Humfrey had conſidered the reaſon which Bellarmin yeeldes, ſurely he could not ſo much haue marauiled that he giues ſo great authority to the councell of Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and preſent Church, for ſaith hee, if we take that away we haue no infallible teſtimonie that the former Councells were euer extant &amp; that they were legitimate and that they defined this or that point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine &amp;c. for the mention which hiſtorians make of thoſe councells is but a humane te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie ſubiect to falſitie, thus Bell. all which diſcourſe of his becauſe he might haue more colour to complaine of him, and the the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, the inſyncere knight reſolued to keep it from the eyes of his reader. True it is that the reformers out of their greate pureneſſe or rather out of their pure madneſſe, doe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2119:114"/> vſually exclaime againſt the ſuppoſed ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Roman Church, but the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts may farre more iuſtly complaine of them in the ſame kinde, in regarde that, ſuperſtition is noething els addording to the etimologie of the worde, but ſuperfluous religion, and to tie the worde of God to the preciſe written caracter alone, in my conceipt, is the higheſt degree of ſuperſtition that can be imagined, becauſe theſe preciſians by that meanes doe ſo exceſſiuelie, and ſuperfluouſly extoll the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten worde, that by their excluſiue hiperbole of the ſufficiencie of it alone, they renounce all other ſortes of worde of God, either preached or otherwise deliuered to the Church, either in plaine tearmes or at the leaſt by neceſſarie ſequelle, which is noething els but out of a ſuperfluous preciſenes, to aſſigne limits to that which is illimitable, and boundes to that which is infinite, and conſequently out of a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious zeale of religion to deſtroyall true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the true worde of God it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore for the ſufficiencie of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten worde preciſelie, the knight citeth the Apoſtle S. Paule act. 20. verſ. 27. were he ſaith ſo: <hi>I haue not shunned to declare vnto you all the councell of God.</hi> but this is ſo impertinentlie alledged that it needes no anſwer: it being manifeſt that the Apoſtle neither ſpeaketh of ſcripture alone, nor intendeth to exclude other
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2119:114"/> partes of the worde of God, nor yet ſo to limit that which he himſelfe writ or ſpoake as if he had deliuered in writing all the doctrine with out exception which is any waie neceſſarie to the ſaluation of euerie mans ſoule both in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and in particular. Otherwiſe it would follow that all which the reſt of the ſacred writers haue published in the ſcriptures were ſuperfluous and no way neceſſarie to haue beene penned. Beſides that S. Paule in the place cited, ſaith not that he hath written, but onely that he hath <hi>declared vnto them all the councell of God,</hi> and ſo he neither in wordes nor se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe fauoureth the reformers tenet of the all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worde but rather Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey is here to be noted for a corruptor of the text. And no leſſe idlely doth the knight cite for the ſame purpoſe the teſtimonie of Bellarm. his meaning being ſo farre from this matter as that if hee were not his aeuerſarie as he is moſt plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie euen in this point, yet had it beene meere madneſſe to haue as much as named him in this darticular, and ſo perhaps for this reaſon onely he was ashamed to quote the place, yet as comonly he doth in other occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Finally for concluſion of his diſproofe of the authoritie of the preſent Roman Church, Sir Humfrey demaundeth of vs how the faith of Chriſtians can depend vpon a Church which is fallen from the faith, or generall beliefe of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2119:115"/> Chriſtianitie can rely ſafely vpon a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell that is diſclaimed by the greateſt parte of the world. By England by France by Germany? But to this I anſwere that in this double queſtion, he telleth his reader at the leaſt a double lye, both which we muſt take vpon his owne credit, for he alledgeth nothing but his owne worthie word, which of how little worth it is we haue ſufficientlie tryed allreadie. Wherefore we muſt with his leaue tell him that neither it is true that the Roman Church is fallen from the faith, except he meanes from the faith of Luther and Caluin, or from his owne English faith, from which neuertheleſſe the Roman Church cannot truelie be affirmed to haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, but it from her, she hauing beene in the world manie hundrethes of yeares before the authours of the new Religion were created: nor is it true that the Tridentine Councell is diſclaimed by the greater parte of France and Germanie at this preſent time in matters of faith. To ſaie nothing of Italie, Spaine, Poland, Hungarie; and thoſe moſt vaſt and ſpatious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Regions of later yeeres reduced to the Roman faith, all with nations doe conteine a farre greater number of ſuch as imbrace the foreſaid Councell then there are reformers in the world who reiect the ſame. Eſpeciallie conſidering that euen amongſt the reformed Churches themſelues notwithſtanding the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2119:115"/> moſt rigorous lawes &amp; proceedings which they vſe againſt the Roman Catholikes where they haue the ſuperioritie of power, yet is there no smale number to be founde of thoſe who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie receiue all the doctrine of faith, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Tridentine Sinod: and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie it appeeres by this that Sir Humfrey hath failed mightilie in his Coſmographie and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, when he affirmeth that the foreſaid Councell is diſclaimed by the greateſt parte of the world; except in his greateſt parte he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Iewes, Turkes and Gentiles, or at the leaſt count for his owne, all thoſe which are not Romaniſts of what ſect or faction ſoeuer they be, as ſome of his reformed brothers vſe to doe not excluding the moſt vnchriſtian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes the Arians out of the number of the members of their Congregation, to make it showe more ample and glorious.</p>
                     <p>After this the knight out of the vehemencie of his zealous Spirit, falls into a fearefull exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration taking vpon him <hi>the Anathema if anie man aliue shall proue that the ſeuen Trent Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were inſtituted by Christ, or that all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or anie one Father in the Primatiue Church, or anie knowne authour for aboute a thouſand yeeres after Chriſt, did teach that there were neither more nor leſſe then ſeuen Sacraments truelie and properlie ſo called, and to be beleeued of all for an article of faith.</hi> Thus hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with ſo manie tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:2119:116"/> and windinges as you ſee, and ſo manie limitations of his ſpeech, that a man would thinke it vnpoſſible but that he might eſcape the ſnare of his owne conditional curſſe, which yet he doth not, but rather falleth flatte into it, as I will preſentlie shewe.</p>
                     <p>And firſt I ſay that if Sir Humfrey would content himſelfe with the authoritie or teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of dead men, I could remitte him not to one but to one hundreth authours who yet aliue in their workes doe teſtifie the foreſaid inſtitution in plaine tearmes, to witt all thoſe diuines who liued and writ euer ſince the time of Petrus Lombardus, of whom as from their common maſter they receaued the doctrine of the ſeuen Sacraments as ſucceſſiuelie deduced from the inſtitution of God, and deliuered it to their ſucceſſours with greate vniformitie and conſent, as appeereth by their bookes. And altho' this might be ſufficient to ſatisfie anie reaſonable perſon in the world, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe becauſe Sir Humfreys importunitie is ſo greate that he will needes haue the teſtimonies of liue authours, I remitte him to all thoſe who either in the publike vniuerſities or pulpits of all Catholike countries doe teach and preach the ſame at this daie to witt that not onelie a thouſand yeeres after Chriſt, but euen from the time of Chriſt himſelfe or at the leaſt from the time of his Apoſtles preaching and writing,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:2119:116"/> there were neither more nor leſſe, then ſeuen Sacraments truelie and properlie ſo called and to be beleeued of all for an article of faith as inſtituted by Chriſt. The number of which authours being not onelie verie greate in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but alſo farre greater and of farre more learned men then all thoſe who in the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches hould the contrarie as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade my ſelfe Sir Humfrey cannot denie: it is moſt euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that (to ſaie nothing of thoſe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers which by their proofes of euerie particular Sacrament by Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes doe plainelie wittneſſe the ſame trueth) he had no reaſon at all for this parte of his greate demaunded.</p>
                     <p>And now touching the reſt of it, I anſwer firſt that as it is certaine the reformers themſelues if we should demaunde the like of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the number of thoſe Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which they defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for truely &amp; properly ſuch, &amp; to be belieued as an article of faith and as inſtituted by Chriſt, cannot prooue either by ſcripture or any one authour, I doe not ſay for about a Thouſand yeeres as they doe, but for a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and foure hundreth yeeres after Chriſt, that they are preciſely twoe and no more nor leſſe: ſo conſequentie they ought not to require of vs that which they themſelues are not able to performe in their owne cauſe and caſe.</p>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:2119:117"/>
                     <p>Neuertheleſſe that our aduerſarie may plainely ſee we are not behinde with him, but rather farre before him and the reſt of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this particular, I anſwer farther that all thoſe Fathers who by expreſſe places of ſcripture proue euerie one of thoſe Sacraments in particular, and no other, which the Roman Church houldeth for truely &amp; properlie ſuch, doe thereby alſo shew at the leaſt tacitly, that thoſe and no more nor leſſe are beleeued for ſuch by faith. For teſtimonie of which trueth becauſe it would be too tedious in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of one argument to produce ſo many of the Fathers as might be alledged, I will onely alledge. <note place="margin">Cal. Inſtit.</note> S. Auguſtine, who beinge euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our aduerſaries oppinion of him, a faithfull witneſſe of antiquitie, his teſtimonie may iuſtly ſerue for all the reſt: and becauſe of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Baptiſme and Euchariſt there is no controuerſie, I will onely produce thoſe teſtimonies which conuince the other fiue.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore that confirmation is truely and properlie a Sacrament S. Auguſtine affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contra lit.

And the like ſaying he hath of the perpetuall effect of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comparing it with the perpetuall effect of Baptiſme. And in the 14. <hi>chapter</hi> of his booke <hi>de bono coniugali,</hi> he compareth matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie with the Sacrament of Order, which order as we haue cited before, he compared with Baptiſme in another place. Finally of Extreame vnction he maketh mention <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de viſit. infir. cap.</hi> 4. and <hi>in his</hi> 215. Sermon of the ſaints. Where although he doth not in expreſſe tearmes affirme extreame vnction to to be one of the Sacraments, yet he expreſſely affirmeth there, <hi>and ſerm. de temp.</hi> 115. that the ceremonie of vnction which S. Iames mentioneth, and the promiſſe, belong vnto the faithfull, and are to be practized by the Prieſts
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:2119:118"/> as the Apoſtle commaundes: all which proues plainily that S. Auguſtin held it for a Sacrament as well as the other ſix, and altho' ſome doubt may be made whether the booke <hi>de viſit. infir.</hi> be truelie S. Auguſtines worke, yet certaine it is that the authour of it is both good and auncient. And thus much out of S. Auguſtine for the proofe of euerie one of the ſeuen Sacraments in particular, beſides that which he ſpeaketh in generall of them, and of the benefit which the Church hath receaued from God by the inſtitution of them, in his firſt ſermon vpon the 108. pſalme, where he ſaith thus. <hi>What a greate gift is the office of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments in Baptiſme, Euchariſt, and in the reſt of the holy Sacraments?</hi> ſo that we ſee that S. Auguſtin ſtanneth plainely againſt the doctrine of Sir Humfrey. And doth fully anſwer his queſtion touching the number of the Sacraments defended by the Roman Church. And ſuppoſing he makes ſoe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall mention of theſe ſeuen as he doth more then of any other externall ſigne or ceremonie of the Church (to ſome of which neuertheles he giueth alſo the name of Sacrament) and ſuppoſing alſo he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth or all moſt of them with thoſe two which the reformers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues hould for proper and true Sacraments, in their effects and ſanctitie, as alſo amplifying the benefit which God hath conferred to the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:2119:118"/> Church by the inſtitution of them (that which he doth not with the reſt of the holie ſignes and ceremonies which the ſame Church alſo vſeth) ſuppoſing all theſe circumſtances I ſaie, it is more then certaine that he ſpeaketh of them as of true and proper Sacramants which for ſuch haue beene recreaued and belieued in the vniuerſall Church euen euer ſince the time of Chriſt the inſtitutour of them. And ſo let this ſuffice for an anſwere of that vaſt deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of our Thraſonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knight, and to demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrate, that notwithſtanding all his circumſpection, his owne conditionall curſe is turned into an abſolute, and ſo is fallen vpon him with all it weight and forces as a iuſt punishment of the temeritie and exceſſe of that boldnes, which he committeth in proteſting, againſt a truth confirmed with ſuch authoritie and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie as may ſatisfie the moſt tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and ſettle the moſt wauering minde in the world. And yet for confirmation of the foreſaid anſwere, we may further adde, that ſuppoſing the Maſter of Sentences ſo manie yeeres paſt defended the ſeauen Sacraments with the inſtitution of them by Chriſt himſelfe and their neceſſitie and profit in the Church of God: and ſuppoſing the ſame authour writ nothing but what he found in the auncient Fathers, from the collection of whoſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he tooke his appellation: ſuppoſing I ſay
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2119:119"/> all this which his workes doe witneſſe, it is moſt apparent in the morall iudgment of anie indifferent man, that the doctrine which he deliuered concerning the foreſaid number of Sacraments, was no other then the faith of the vniuerſall Church &amp; alſo the verie ſame which by the generall conſent of ſchoole diuines in later ages hath binne taught &amp; preached euen by thoſe of the Grecian Church, as by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Hieremie the late Patriarch of Conſtantinople in his anſwer to the Auguſtan Confeſſion doth plainelie appeere; where the ſeptenarie number of Sacraments is expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie maintained againſt the Lutherans as his wordes here quoted in the margent clearelie teſtifie with shame enuffe to the reformed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for thus he ſaith. <note place="margin">Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>But the knight goeing yet further in the proofe of his duall number, telleth his reader, that the two Sacraments which his Church defends are properlie Sacraments becauſe they haue element and inſtitution: but the other fine are not ſuch becauſe they want eyther of theſe. But to this I anſwere that the fiue Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which the reformers reiect, haue not
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2119:119"/> onelie this which Sir Humfrey requires to his two defaced Sacraments, but alſo beſides this, they haue promiſe of iuſtificant grace, which according to the deſcription he maketh heere, his two doe want; and ſo I retort his prrofe vpon him. For if our fiue be not properlie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments becauſe in his conceipt they want inſtitution and element; ſurelie neither are his two properlie Sacraments becauſe they want grace, as being but ſignes or elements inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God not giuing grace both according to his former declaration, <note place="margin">Caluin. Inſtit. lib. 4. cap. 14. &amp; 15.</note> and alſo in the common doctrine of the reformers: And ſo we ſee that the knightes diſcourſe touching the propertie of his two miniſteriall elements is but a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe peice of doctrine, eſpeciallie conſidering that if he had binne but halfe ſo conuerſant in our diuines as he will needes ſeeme to be, he might moſt eaſilie haue found both inſtitution element, and grace, annexed to all thoſe fiue Sacraments which he renounceth: which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike diuines altho' they doe not all agree in the aſſignation of the ſeuerall matters and formers of the ſame, yet doe they neuertheleſſe with great conformitie conſent in the number &amp; generall definition of them, to wit that they are all externall and ſenſible ſignes which by diuine inſtitution haue the promiſe of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace annexed. And leaſt the knight take exceptions and complaine that I doe not
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2119:120"/> ſatisfiie his argument my ſelfe, but remit him to others for an anſwere; I will breiflie shewe out of ſcripture both the inſtitution and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euerie one of the foreſaid fiue Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in particular. Confirmation therefore was inſtituted by Chriſt in thoſe places of ſcripture where he promiſeth to his Apoſtles the Holie Ghoſt after his aſcenſion, as S. Iohn the 16.5. Luke the 24.48. which collation of the holie Ghoſt was exerciſed by the Apoſtles Act. 10. &amp; 19. by impoſition of hands after they had receaued the ſame holie Ghoſt by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie manner which is deſcribed Act. 2. which impoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> togither with the words vſed Act. 8. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they prayed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on whom they put their hands, are the matter and forme of this Sacrament. And now heere we ſee both the inſtitution and the element in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is all Sir Humfrey requireth of vs; and ſo I will ſay vnto him that which S. Hierome ſaid to his aduerſaries the Luciferians the 4. chap. <hi>Si quaeris quare in Eccleſia baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus non niſi per manus Epiſcopi accipit Spiritum Sanctum, diſce hanc obſeruationem exea authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate deſcendere quod poſt aſcenſionem Domini Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ad Apoſtolos deſcendit,</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>If thow doeſt aske me, why he that is baptized doth not receaue the holie Ghoſt but by the hands of the Bishop, learne that this obſeruation deſcended from that authoritie that after the aſcenſion of our Lord
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2119:120"/> the Spirit deſcended vpon the Apoſtles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondlie the Sacrament of Penance hath both element and inſtitution; the element is the acts of the penitent declared by ſenſible words or ſignes, the inſtitution is the collation of power conferred by Chriſt to remitte ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to his Apoſtles and in them to all true Preiſtes according to that of the 20. of Saint Iohn, <hi>Receaue yee the holie Ghost, whole ſinnes you shall forgiue they are forgiuen, and whoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes you shall retaine they are retayued.</hi> In which words both the inſtitution and the element be ſufficientlie declared; eſpeciallie if we ioyne the declaration of the Church, without which euen thoſe two which the reformers hould for Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be conuinced to be truly and properlie ſuch, if one were obſtinately diſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdlie in the Sacrament of Extreme Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction both the element and inſtitution are plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie enough found in the 5. chap. of S. Iames: where the Apoſtle ſayth. <hi>If anie man be ſick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, let him bring in the Prieſtes of the Church and let them pray ouer him annointing him with oyle in the name of our Lord, and the prayer of faith shall ſaue the ſick, and our Lord shall lift him vp, and if he be in ſinnes they shalbbe remitted him.</hi> In which place to the externall ſignes of prayer and oyle, remiſſion of finnes is annexed, as the reader may plainelie perceiue: which effect euen according to the doctrine of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:2119:121"/> themſelues as I ſuppoſe cannot be found but onelie in ſuch ceremonies as properlie are inſtituted by Chriſt himſelfe for Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>Fourthlie the like I ſay of Order, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which is ſo plainelie conteyned in the ſcriptures, <note place="margin">Vid. Cal. l. 3. Inſt. c. 4. §. 20. &amp;c. 19. §. 31.</note> that ſome of the greateſt reformers haue not had the face to exclude it out of the number of the Sacraments of the new lawe, and the places of Scripture which conuince the truth of it are 1. Timo. 4. and 2. Thimothie 1. where both the ſenſible element which is the impoſition of hands, and the effect of grace an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, are cleerlie deſcribed; which effect I thinke our aduerſaries confeſſe, cannot be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie conferred but onelie by Gods authoritie and inſtitution. The wordes of the Apoſtle are theſe in the firſt place. <hi>Doe not neglect the grace which is in the: which was giuen the by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie with the impoſition of the hands of preiſthood.</hi> In the ſecond place the wordes are theſe. <hi>For which cauſe I admonish the to reſuſcitate the grace of God which is in the by the impoſition of my handes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now laſtlie concerning Matrimonie, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might iuſtlie maruell that our new Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes should make anie queſtion of it in this nature. For ſuppoſing their extraordinarie affection that way, and that ſingle life is ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauourie to them that if it lay in their power, they would rather ſuffer the whole quire of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:2119:121"/> virgins to perish, then they would make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious vowe of perpetuall chaſtitie, or liue without a woman: ſuppoſing this I ſay in my opinion they ought in all reaſon ſooner to haue honoured matrimonie with the title of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, then to haue quite depriued it of that which the ſcripture it ſelfe doth giue it. Yet ſuppoſing they be ſo prepoſterous, that they will rather impugne that which they other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe loue beſt, then ſeeme to agree to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane doctrine, I tell them all and particularilie him with whome I diſpute, that although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was by God himſelfe onelie ordayned in paradiſe as a ciuill contract: Neuertheleſſe Chriſte who came not to diſſolue the lawe, but to eleuate it to a higher degree of perfection; amongſt other things he pleaſed to honore the ſame with the true nature and properties of a Sacrament; giuing alſo tho' not immediatlie by himſelfe, yet by his Apoſtle S. Paul, the verie name and title of a Sacrament; whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding neyther he himſelfe nor anie of his Apoſtles or Euangeliſts euer gaue that name to anie of the reſt of the Sacraments. Wherefore to come nearer to the purpoſe; I ſay that the inſtitution of this Sacrament was by Chriſte himſelfe, who in the 19. chapter of S. Mathewe ordayned the coniunction of man &amp; wife to be inſeperable to the end it ſo might be a ſacred ſigne of the indiſſoluble coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2119:122"/> of Chriſte and his Church, as it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Apoſtle Epheſ. 5. where he expreſlie giueth it the name of a <hi>great Sacrament</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſacred coniunction (partelie by the hypoſtaticall vnion, and partelie by the vnion of charitie) betwixt Chriſte and his ſpouſe the Church which it ſignifieth. Which foreſaid coniunction of man and wife explicated by words of the preſent tenſe is the element; and Chriſts ordinance and application of the ſame to the foreſaid ſignification, is the inſtitution, by virtue of which it alſo conferreth grace to the receiuers, to the end they may liue in that perpetuall vnion of mindes which is required to the repreſentation of the inſeperable vnion of Chriſte and his Church; which is all and more then our aduerſarie himſelfe demaunded of vs before in this particular matter. To which if we adde the authoritie of the Church and auncient fathers for the interptetation of thoſe ſcriptures which we haue produced for proofe of the truth of this, and the reſt of the foreſaid fiue Sacraments (which authorities of the fathers if need required and the place did ſerue for them I could eaſilie produce) it would yet more plainelie appeere with how little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the pretenſiue reformed Congregations doe exclude them out of the number of true and proper Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>And ſo now according to this a verie eaſie
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2119:122"/> anſwere may be framed to all that which the knight bringeth againſt the ſeptenarie num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sacraments in the reſt of this paragraph, and particularilie to the teſtimonies of thoſe Romane authours and Fathers which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth in fauour of his cauſe. And firſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Fathers which hee citeth beſides that which hath binne alreadie ſpoken I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adde, that there was not one of them which was of the reformers opinion in this matter as is moſt apparent in that Sir Humfrey himſelfe could not produce ſo much as one Father that auerreth the onelie duall number of Sacraments: Nay they are ſo farre ftom this, that there is not one of them, who doth not in one place or other make expreſſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more then two, if profeſſedlie they make mention of anie at all.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie I ſay, that as the reformers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with anie probabilitie inferre out of thoſe Fathers who affirmed that the two Sacraments Baptiſme and the Euchariſt haue flowed out of the ſide of Chriſte, that there are no more nor leſſe then two; ſo neyther can they in anie ſort thence inferre that the ſame Fathers taught not the ſeptenarie number of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And more then this if the reformers ſtand vpon this ſo much that the Fathers by the bloud which iſſued out of our Sauiours ſide, vnderſtood the Sacrament of the bloud of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2119:123"/> Chriſte, then they muſt conſequentlie eyther confeſſe that the ſame Fathers held the reall preſence of the bloude of Chriſte in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, which yet they themſelues denie, or elſe at the leaſt that the reformed Churches haue no true Sacrament at all, for that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their confeſſion, there is in it neyther bloud nor bone. And out of this generall anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were to the teſtimonies of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we may inferre how falſelie Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey in the end of his 149. page affirmeth, that they did inſiſt ſometimes in the number of two and ſo reſtrayned the Church to the definite number of two onelie, which ſaying of his is a manifeſt falſitie and iniurious to thoſe Fathers whome he ſo chargeth, as that which I haue produced out of S. Auguſtine in this period doth plainelie conuince in theſe fiue Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the reformers denie: Neyther was he able to produce one teſtimonie out of anie of them for proofe of his fayned poſition; but ſo leaueth it vnconfirmed more then with that fame vntruth by which he belyeth moſt impudentlie the foreſaid Fathers all at a clappe.</p>
                     <p>Neyther hath that which he further addeth of the ſame Fathers in the next page anie greater truth or foundation then this, where he ſayth that had the Fathers beleeued that thoſe fiue Sacraments had binne inſtituted by Chriſte they would of neceſſitie haue concluded them
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2119:123"/> for true and proper Sacraments, and haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie found in them the number of ſeuen: Thus in effect Sir Humfrey diſcourſeth, to which I anſwere firſt that doubtles if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had had but halfe the occaſion which the Church hath had ſince their time, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſince the foundation of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; they would of neceſſitie haue treated and ſpoken expreſſelie of the ſeptenarie number, and haue diſtinguished as now the Church and diuines doe betwixt proper and improper Sacraments: But the occaſion fayling, they neyther had neceſſitie nor conueniencie to ſpeake otherwiſe of them then they haue don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: Nay ſome of them, eſpeciallie thoſe who writ againſt the Gentiles, were rather obliged by the courſe of thoſe times, not to mention the ſecret miſteries of our faith at all, then to reueale them to the profaners of them, more then was preciſelie neceſſarie for the anſwere of their obiections, <note place="margin">Vid. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret. Dial. 2.</note> which indeed is the true reaſon, why diuerſe of the foreſaid more aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers haue ſpoken ſo obſcurelie and ſparinglie euen of ſome of the cheife miſteries of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie I ſay, that howſoeuer the auncient Fathers ſpoke of the expreſſe number of the Sacraments, certaine it is, they eyther expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie taught, or at the leaſt ſuppoſed for certaine doctrine of faith that all thoſe which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2119:124"/> Church now holdeth for true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sacraments doe giue diuine grace to the receiuers, as it is apparent out of thoſe places which I cited before out of Saint Auguſtine for the proofe of euerie ſeuerall Sacrament and their ſeuerall effects; and conſequentlie they held implicitelie at the leaſt, and if either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie or iuſte occaſion had required they would haue concluded expreſſelie the ſepte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie number of Sacraments, and that they were inſtituted by Chriſte for ſuch truely and properly.</p>
                     <p>And now for the more moderne diuines who wrote ſince the time of P. Lumbard, of which Sir Humfrey citeth to the number of twelue or thirteene, there is not one of them who holdeth onely two proper Sacraments as the reformers doe: nay there is not one of them that doth not expreſlie defende the ſeptenarie number of true and proper Sacraments, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perhaps Alexander Hales and Durand may ſeeme to opinate otherwiſe to the incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect reader, of which two authours neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe I ſay firſt that Hales doth not denie all thoſe ſeauen, nor anie one of them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar which the Romane Church defendes to be trulie and properlie Sacraments, but he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is of opinion that onelie fower of them are to be called Sacraments of the new lawe, for that as he imagined the other three, to wit Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2119:124"/> Order, and Matrimonie, had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning before. True it is, Hales cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from errour in that he affirmeth Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to haue binne inſtituted by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Melda (except he meaneth onelie, that there it was declared to be properlie a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as I am perſuaded he doth) but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe ſuppoſing this his ſingular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet notwithſtanding it being with all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, that he holdeth the ſame Sacrament to be one of the ſeauen no leſſe then he doth Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which yet he held (as it ſeemeth to ſome later writers) to haue binne inſtituted by the Apoſtles, <note place="margin">Iuxta nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merum malorum ſpiritualiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> debet ſumi numerus Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Hal. 4. part. q. 8. mem. 7. act. 2.</note> notwithſtanding all this I ſay, he is impertinentlie alleaged by the knight as an impugner of the Romane doctrine in the ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenarie number of Sacraments, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his other allucinations, he as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſelie maintaines as other diuines doe as his owne wordes plainelie teſtifie ſaying thus in his 4. parte and eight queſtion. <hi>According to the number of ſpirituall diſeaſes, the number of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments is to be taken, there are ſeauen differences of diſeaſes.</hi> What therefore can be more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that this authour tought the compleat number of ſeuen Sacraments?</p>
                     <p>And as for Durand, certaine it is that he doth not denie Matrimonie to be a Sacrament ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelie as the reformers doe, but he at the moſt onely affirmeth that it is not properly
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2119:125"/> and vniuocallie a Sacrament conferring grace in the ſame manner the other ſix doe; which opinion of his altho' as it ſounds it can not ſtand firme with the doctrine of the Church: yet this not our queſtion, and in caſe it were, yet is there no reaſon why one mans priuate tenet, nay nor the priuate tenet, or errour of more then one or two should preiudicate the common doctrine of the Church both before and after him, nor diminish her antiquitie and vniuerſalitie in anie point of doctrine eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie where there is no obſtinacie in the authour, as in theſe there was not: neyther can the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries drawe anie argument of force againſt the ſame in anie caſe, out of one onelie authour or more, if more there were, contrarie to the torrent of all the reſt. To omit that as vaſques noteth, the ſame Durand in the ſame place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſlie affirmeth that it is an hereſie to denie that Matrimonie is a Sacrament, which doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſſe is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that when Dura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d affirmed Matrimonie not to be vniuocallie or iuſte as the reſt be a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he did not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny it to be one of thoſe ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the church did both then hold, &amp; now houldeth to betrue Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; but at the moſt he onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the truth &amp; propertie of it in that ſtrict &amp; vniuocall manner of conferring iuſtifica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t grace, as he and other diuines affirme of the reſt: which being ſo, then cannot the Reformers
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2119:125"/> haue anie colour to alledge this teſtimonie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the abſolute truth of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or againſt the Septenarie number of it with the other. Nay more then this hauing now exactelie examined the matter I finde that Durand beſides that he expreſſelie defendes the total number of ſeuen Sacraments diſputing ſeuerallie of the nature of euerie one of them, he doth in particular affirme of Matrimonie euen in his reſolution or direct anſer to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, abſolutelie that it is a Sacrament; and puts it in the laſt place for one of the ſeuen. And theſe are his wordes in their ſeuerall places noted in the margent.<note place="margin">Tenendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te quod matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium eſt Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Marke, was not the Sacrament of Extreme Vnction, but rather a figure or obumbration of it: Which as you ſee is a farre different mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the deniall of Extreme Vnction as it is vſed in the Church, to be properlie a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or one of the fiue reiected by the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue reformed Congregations. Thirdlie the knight corrupteth Bellarmin whome he cites in the nynth chapter of his firſt booke of the Sacraments, where he peruertes both the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the wordes and ſenſe. The wordes
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2119:127"/> in that he Englisheth theſe, <hi>non eſt ita notum, it is not ſo certaine,</hi> whereas he ought to haue tranſlated, it is not ſo knowne: The ſenſe he corrupteth in that he perſuades his reader that Bellarmin confeſſeth that the foreſaid fiue Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments haue not their inſtitution from chriſt immediatelie: whereas he ſpeakes not a worde of the inſtiturion, but affirmes onelie that the ſacred things which the Sacraments ſignifie are three; iuſtifying grace, the paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt and eternall life; all which, that Baptiſme and Eucharrſt doe fignifie ſaith he, <hi>res notiſsima est,</hi> it is moſt notorious, <hi>de alijs Sacramentis non eſt ita notum,</hi> of the reſt of the Sacraments it is not ſo notorious or knowne. Yet further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that it is certaine that euen theſe fiue Sacraments which the reformers reiect ſignifie all thoſe three things at the leaſt impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citlie: But to ſaie that the foreſaid fiue Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue not their inſtitution immediatelie from Chriſt, neuer entred in to Bellarmins thoughts. <note place="margin">tamen cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt ſaltem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite ea omnia ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificare &amp;c.

                     <p>Furthermore Sir Humfrey alſo corrupteth vaſquez moſt shamefullie in the 3. parte d. 2. cap. 5. n. 3. de Sacram. Matr. Where he impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie belyeth him affirming that Vaſquez knewe well that neither moderne diuines nor
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:2119:127"/> auncient Fathers did conclude Matrimonie for a true Sacrament of the Church. And yet the knight could not be ignorant that the ſame authour profeſſedlie defendes the ſame to be trulie and properlie a Sacrament in the third chapter of the verie ſame diſputation which he himſelfe cites: and in his 4. chap. Vaſquez proueth it by the teſtimonies of diuers Fathers, putting for parte of the title of the ſame chap. that the <note place="margin">Vaſquez de Mat.</note> 
                        <hi>definition of the Church touching the truth of this Sacrament had foundation in the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Fathers,</hi> and who will pleaſe to read vaſquez will finde it ſo. In ſo much that Sir Humfrey in this particular is wholelie inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, eſpeciallie conſidering that out of the place cited nothing can poſſiblie be collected or inferred wherebie it may in anie ſorte be imagined that vaſquez euer dreamed that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther auncient Fathers or moderne diuines (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting durand and perhaps the Maſter of Sentences of whome he ſpeakes doubtfullie, not daring to affirme him abſolutelie to haue beene of the ſame opinion with Durand, as in truth he is not) did conclude matrimonie not to be a true and proper Sacrament, but onelie affirmes that none of the places which diuines alledge out of S. Auguſtin to proue the truth and propertie of that Sacrament, conuince the ſame in the ſenſe in which (ſaith Vaſquez) we now diſpute. Which imagination of Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2119:128"/> tho' it were true, as in my iudgement ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parentlie it is not, yet doth it not proue <hi>Sir Humfreys intent</hi> in diſprouing the ſeptenarie number of Sacraments. Eſpeciallie ſuppoſing, as the ſame Vaſquez affirmes, <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Carth. 4.</note> that the fourth Councell of Carthage (in which <hi>S. Auguſtin was preſent</hi> as a great member of the ſame) makes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of the Benediction of the Preiſt vſed in mariage as in a holie and ſacred thing. Graunt I ſay that Vaſquez opinion were true, yet would it not ſerue the knights turne, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the poofe of his intent, or for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of his falſe and craftie dealing.</p>
                     <p>Next after Vaſquez I will put Suarez althou' according to the order of Sir Humfrey he is the firſt man he belies in this Poragraph. in 3. part d. 12. ſec. 1. where he charges him to ſaye that the councell of Florence did inſinuate the number of 7. Sacraments, <note place="margin">Propter quod tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem haec veritas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finita eſt in Con. Flor. in decreto Eugenij qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Graeci &amp; Armeni facile cum Latinis ſuceperu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Suar. loc. cit.</note> and the councell of Trent did expreſſelie decree it for an article of faith, yet ſuarez ſayes in plaine termes, that the ſame was defyned in the councell of Florence. So that here is falſe dealing with ſuarez and with the truth to make the point of the ſepte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie number of Sacraments ſeeme newe, as ther is alſo in the wordes following in which the ſame Sir Humfrey affirmes that the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts relie wholely vpon the Tridentine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſe, Auſtin, Chryſoſtome and Bede
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:2119:128"/> be impertinently alleged. For they none of them denie that the Sacraments are no more nor leſſe then ſeuen. And of S. Iſidore it is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely affirmed by Sir Humfrey that he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth but of 3. Sacraments for altho' in the place quoted by him he ſpeakes onely of three (which yet is more then the knight will alowe of) yet doth he not affirme that ther are no more: yea &amp; in other ſeuerall places he mentioneth three more, Pennance, Order, matrimonie. And of them all he treates onely occaſionallie not profeſſedlie as the reader may eaſilie perceiue, and therfore doubtleſſe there is no mention of Extreme vnction among the reſt, of which neuertheleſſe he was not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t how plainelie S. Iames deſcribes it, neither would haue omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it if occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had ſerued to treate of it. Of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he treates lib. 8. orig. page 83. &amp; lib. 2. de offi. Eccleſ. of Order in his 2. booke de offic. Eccleſ. page 597. and 598. and of matrimonie he hath expreſſe wordes in the ſame booke page 69.</p>
                     <p>Touching S. Chryſoſtome, Ambroſe, Cyrill and Theophilactus it is falſe that they maintained onely two Sacraments, and as for Chryſoſtome and Theophilactus, vpon the 6. of S. Paule to the Hebrewes, they both make mention of Confirmation. S. Ambroſe lib. 1. de Penit: makes a kynde of compariſon betwixt Baptiſme and Pennance, ſaying: <hi>vnum in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2119:129"/> vtroque miniſterium eſt, &amp;c.</hi> and S. Cyrill of Ieruſalem lib. 12. in ſo. cap. 56. doth alſoe compare theſe two Sacraments together, and both of them mention the Sacrament of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. the one <hi>Catech.</hi> 3. <hi>the other lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Sacra. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; de ijs qui mysterijs initiantur cap.</hi> 7. ſo that none of thes Fathers which Sir Humfrey produced for the number of 2. onely Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doe agree with his doctrine: and yet more not one of them treates in anie one place of their workes of the preciſe number of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but onely ſoe farre as their matter and drift required.</p>
                     <p>Paſcaſius alſo is falſelie dealt with by Sir Humfrey, both in his meaning and in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his wordes: for the doth not ſaye, the Sacramets of Chriſt are Baptiſme, Chriſme, and the bodie and bloude of our lord, as Sir Humfrey doth put in English but. <hi>Sunt autem Sacramenta Christi in Eccleſia:</hi> that is: <hi>but Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt in the Church be Baptiſme Chryſme &amp;c.</hi> Meaning onelie that Baptiſme, Chryſme and the Euchariſt are ſuch Sacraments as he treates of makeing mention of thoſe onely, not to showe the preciſe number but the nature of a Sacrament in generall, eſpeciallie touching the ſignification and effects of the ſame, and therfore he doth exemplifie in thoſe onely which are moſt notoriouſlie knowne for ſuch and their matter and formes moſt obuious,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2119:129"/> omitting the reſt as being leſſe to the purpoſe he ther handleth. And for Sir Humfrey to affirme that Chriſme is crept in to the text of the later editions, that is but an idle imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne, otherwiſe ſure he would haue produced ſome other more auncient edition in which the worde Chryſme is not found. And certainelie he that should compare the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, and ſinceritie of the Romoniſts in that nature, and the care they haue to publish au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours purely, with the inſinceritie of the ſectaries, he would preſentlie iudge that copie which wantes the worde Chriſme to be razed by them that haue of late yeares abolished the vſe of it in their Church, rather then haue the leaſt ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world that the ſame should be added by Romaniſts whoſe doctrine and practice in that particular is ſo frequent and auncient. Eſpecially conſidering that it makes no more to our purpoſe of maintaining the ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenarie of Sacraments againſt the pretended reformers, whether the worde Chryſme be in Paſcaſius or no, then if it were vndoubtedlie true that he had made no mention of it. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it is ſufficient for vs to knowe that this author in that place neither intended to proue the number of three Sacraments, nor yet to exclude the number of ſeuen. Howbeit, I doe not denie but that the worde Chryſme being in the text, it ſuffices to conuince that the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:2119:130"/> Sacraments of Chriſt are more then two. And in deed I maruell why the ſectaries eſpeciallie thoſe of the English Church should labore ſo much to exclude Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the number of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſuppoſing they either doe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice if or at the leaſt ought to practiſe it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, altho' ther is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preſcribed by them touching the vſe of Chryſme, but onely or cheefelie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion is made of the blowe which the confirmer giues to the confirmed with a certaine phraſe or forme of wordes. Concerning which ceremonie I haue heard that vpon a time, a certaine nominall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of theirs at the time of adminiſtration, was ſo extraordinarie well pleaſed with one of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, of the feminine gender, that in ſteed of the ceremoniall ſtroake he gaue her a kiſſe of kindeneſſe, by which the yonge maide aſſured her ſelfe she receiued more grace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if she had receiued Confirmation it ſelfe accordnig to their ordinarie manner. And now this may be ſufficient for the true meaning of Paſcaſius.</p>
                     <p>Hugo a ſancto Victore is moſt peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelie dealt with when out of Perkins he is produced by Sir Humfrey againſt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Pennance. For I haue read him lib. 1. de Sacramentis cap. 12. where he ſayes thus in expreſſe termes. <hi>Septem ſunt principalia Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta quae in Eccleſia miniſtrantur. ther be ſeuen principall Sacraments which are miniſtred in the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2119:130"/> Church.</hi> And he numbers them in particular and Pennance for one: And in his ſumma ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <hi>tract.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. he ſaith. <hi>Sacramentum Paenitentiae redeuntibus ad Deum ſemper eſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarium. Eſt enim ſecunda tabula poſt naufra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium, quia poſt baptiſmum ſi quis veſtem inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiae peccando amittit per paenitentiam recuperare poterit.</hi> And by this you plainelie ſee this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt is groaſlie abuſed both by Perkins, and his imitatour, as if he were a denier of the ſeptenarie number of Sacraments who ſoe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie doth acknowledge them. As in like manner the ſame authour is abuſed by the knight page 128. Touching the cuſtome of the communion of the people at euerie Maſſe in the Primatiue Church, by omiſſion of his enſuing wordes which are theſe. <hi>Sed propter peccatum circumſtans nunc ſtatutum est vt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municaremus ſolum ſemel in anno.</hi> That is to ſaie. <hi>But by reaſon of ſinne which doth compaſe vs aboute, it is now decreed that we communicate thrice a yeare.</hi> Whereas likewiſe neither in the former wordes of this authour cited by Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, ther is a iot againſt priuate Maſſe, as he would haue it, but onelie a relation of diuers cuſtomes of the Church in that particular point of practice, as I haue declared in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph of that matter.</p>
                     <p>Beſſario<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his wordes rehearſed by Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey doth not denie the ſeptenarie nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, nor doth
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:2119:131"/> abſolutely affirme that there are onelie two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but onelie ſaith that we read of two onely manifeſtly deliuered in the Goſpell: which is not contrarie to the Tridentine Councell, nor yet that which the knight intendes to proue, to wit that the doctrine of ſeuen Sacraments is no article of faith. And what if Beſſarion should ſaie that ſome of the ſeuen Sacraments are found not in the Goſpell but in the Epiſtle, what would Sir Humfrey replie to that? But in earneſt I haue vewed Beſſarions treatie of the Euchariſt where I finde that, altho' he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes no plaine mention of the ſeuen Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as not hauing anie iuſte occaſion there offered to handle that matter, yet out of ſome paſſages of his diſcourſe with other circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there vnto annexed, it is euidentlie gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what his meaning, and faith was touching the ſame. For in the place cited by the knight and ther aboutes, Cardinall Beſſarion treates particularlie of the forme of the Sacrament of Euchariſt, prouing that it conſiſts of no other wordes then thoſe ſame which our Sauiour himſelfe conſecrated with, and deliuered to the Church videlicet. <hi>This is my bodie: This is my bloud.</hi> And by occaſion of this he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth Baptiſme, as being one of the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which onelie haue their formes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſelie and in ſpeciall termes contained in the Goſpell and ſpecified by Chriſt himſelfe. And
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:2119:131"/> therefore a little before that which Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey cited out of this authour, he ſaide. <hi>Illud quoque haud contemnendum videtur quod cum duo nobis Sacramenta à Saluatore traditae fuerint Baptiſmus &amp; Euchariſtia vtrumque verbis ſuis confici iuſsit:</hi> By which wordes it is certaine &amp; cleare that he there ſpeakes onelie of ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments as our Sauiour moſt verbally or moſt expreſſelie ordained his diſciples to conſecrate and adminiſter.</p>
                     <p>And now that this Cardinall did beleeue that there are more Sacraments then theſe, it is euidentlie conuinced out of thoſe his wordes fol. 169. ſaying. <hi>Ante omniaigitur ſciendum est tam hoc Sacroſanctum Communionis de quo agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus quam caetera Eccleſiae Sacramenta ideo ſacra vocitari, quoniam aliud in ſe habent quod videtur aliud quod non corporis oculis ſed ſolo intellectu comprehenditur.</hi> And after in the ſame page. <hi>Etenim in Sacramento Baptiſmatis ablutio carnis per aquam ita eſt Sacrementum vt duntaxat ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſit ablutionis peccatorum. Ipſa enim pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum remiſsio res eſt ſignificata nihil vltra ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficans.</hi> And to theſe wordes he preſentlie addes that which is plainelie to our purpoſe, to wit: <hi>Hoc idem in reliquis Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tis. Ergo &amp; in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento Eucharistia.</hi> And yet more plainelie f. 175. <hi>Que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>admodum in caeteris omnibus, ita etiam in hoc Sacramento concordes ſunt Occidenibus Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales.</hi> That is. Euen as in all the reſt ſo in this
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:2119:132"/> Sacrament the Occidentals (that is the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts) doe accorde with the Orientals) that is the Grecians). Beſides, this authour was a Greek Cardinall of the Roman Church, and a cheefe agent, and promoter for the vnion of the Latin and Greek Church in the Councell of Florence, where the number of ſeuen Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was defined and declared. To omit that the ſame Beſſarion fol. 181. makes expreſſe mention of the Sacrament of Confirmation for ſo he ſaith. <hi>Quod manifeſtum fiet ſi quis ad Sacramentum Chryſmatis mentem conuerterit.</hi> So that Sir Humfrey could ſcarce a choſen a worſe Patron for proofe of his pare of deformed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, then is this Cardinall, if he had ſought all Greece ouer: it being manifeſt that he was a profeſſed defender not onelie of the two Sacraments he mentioneth in the place cited by him, but alſo a firme beleeuer of the other fiue which the pretended reformers renounce &amp; thruſt violentlie out of the rancke of true Sacraments. It is true I haue aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome ſmale ſleight of Sir Humfrey in tranſlating or transforming the worde mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſte in Latin, into the worde plainelie in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish: but this but one of his diminutiue trickes and ſo I paſſe it ouer. Onelie I deſire the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader to reflect how peruers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous a generation this is which refuſeth to beleeue points of doctrine becauſe they are
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2119:132"/> not manifeſtelie contained in the ſcripture. Whereas on the contrarie this moſt learned and Catholike Cardinall Beſſarion altho' he graunted that two onelie Sacraments of the Church are ſo expreſſed in the written worde of God, yet doth he with a firme and conſtant faith imbrace the reſt.</p>
                     <p>S.

But theſe men being much more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cauille then to finde the truth: they would not caſte their eyes ſo farre, but onelie layed handes vpon that which came neareſt in their waye, I meane vpon ſome of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruences onelie (and yet purpoſelie omitting the cheefe) which that pious diuine makes vſe of more for explication then for proofe of the doctrine. And thus theſe ill occupied Pedants trifle with him who had more learning, and grauitie, without compariſon, then they and their whole Congregation nor yet had they both wit to cite the place they alledged trulie, but quoted the ſecond booke for the fourth.</p>
                     <p>Iuſte according to this manner of proceeding the knight alſo dealeth with S. Thomas, the Councell of Trent, and Bellarmin and others, as if they had beene ſo deſtitute of arguments of ſcripture and Fathers for their proofes of the ſeuen Sacraments, that they were glad to refuge to figures and ſimilitudes of ſeuen vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſeuen capitall vices, ſeuen planets, ſeuen
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2119:134"/> defects proceeding from Originall ſinne, ſeuen dayes of vnleauened bread, the offering of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Rams, ſeuen lauers of naaman, ſeuen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtickes, ſeuen ſeales, ſeuen bookes and the like: whereas in truth theſe myſticall numbers are applied to the ſeuen Sacraments by the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſaid authours whereby to confirme and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the matter more plainelie ouer and aboue their other moſt pregnant and authenticall proofes of the ſame as in them all and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie in S. Thomas, and bellarmin, is too plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie to be ſeene in their workes, to be brought in queſtion by anie one of reading and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; S. Thomas hauing ſeuen ſeuerallie diſtinct queſtions of the ſeuen Sacraments a parte, beſides that he hath of them in generall: and the like I ſay of Bellarmin. And as for the Councell of Trent it either produceth proofes of ſcripture and Fathers actuallie for euerie particular Sacrament, or remittes the reader to other former Councells and decrees which haue them. And ſo wee ſee by this that Sir Humfrey doth but cogge and trifle for wante of ſolid ſubiect.</p>
                     <p>Touching the citation of Caietan vpon the 5. cap. of S. Iames, it is true I finde the ſame which Sir Humfrey relates at the leaſt in ſenſe, and ſo I cannot accuſe him in this place of the ordinarie imperfection which he vſeth in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting authours. Neuertheleſſe he might eaſilie
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2119:134"/> haue knowne that the ſame Caietan in his Commentarie vpon the 65. queſtion of the 3. parte of S. Thomas art. 1. doth agree with him in the ſeptenarie number of Sacraments: and therefore in his gloſſe vpon the ſecond article of that ſame queſtion he numbers Extreme Vnction for one of the ſeuen, ſaying: <hi>In titulo intellige per ordinem praedictum, ordinem quo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merata ſunt Sacramenta in praecedenti articulo. videlieet Baptiſma, Confirmatio, Euchariſtia, Paenitentia, Extrema Vnctio, Ordo, Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi> By which it is manifeſt that Caietan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with his maſter S. Thomas Extreme Vnction to be a Sacrament, and conſequentlie he is no fauourer of Sir Humfrey in this point of which now we treat. And the ſame I ſaye of the ſame Caietan alledged by the knight as ſaying that the reader cannot inferre out of the wordes of S. Paule, <hi>Sacramentum hoc magnum est,</hi> that matrimonie is a Sacrament, becauſe ſainct Paule ſaith not, <hi>Sacramentum hoc magnum eſt, ſed myſterium hoc magnum eſt.</hi> But what ſoeuer out of the predominating ſubtiltie of his wit, Caietan held of the interpretation of this place of ſainct Paule: in which as alſo in the expoſition of ſome other ſcriptures, he is noted and notorious to haue beene more ſubtil then ſolid, yet certaine it is that he abſolutelie defended Matrimonie to be one of the ſeuen Sacraments of the Church as both his wordes
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:2119:135"/> aboue cited doe manifeſtlie conuince, and alſo the great pu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuality with which he is knowne to haue obſerued and followed his much reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and reuerenced Patron ſainct Thomas in all points of doctrine, ſwearing in a manner euerie where in the wordes of his maſter; ſo that the knight cannot haue as much as anie conlorable reaſon to imagin that Caietan ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des for him in this matter and againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts: As neither he hath to conceiue the like of Canus, whome he in the ſame manner cites as if we were a denier of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to be a Sacrament, or at the leaſt a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier that other diuines pronounce doubtfullie of the ſame: whereas in reallitie Canus in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his owne priuate opinion that matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie is not a Sacrament nor conferreth grace except when it is adminiſtred by a Preiſt, doth onelie name ſome diuines which varie in their opinions concerning the determinate matter &amp; forme of matrimonie, and touching the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner how or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it giues grace, yet both he and the reſt conſtantlie &amp; expreſſely teaching, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelie it hath both matter and forme and giues graces in one ſorte or other, and numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it among the reſt of the ſeuen Sacraments as their writings doe teſtifie. So that it was great prepoſterouſneſſe in Sir Humfrey to vſe the teſtimonie of Canus againſt the truth of the Sacrament of Matrimonie ſince neither he
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2119:135"/> nor thoſe other diuines which he names viz. Lombard, Scotus, ſainct Thom. Ricard. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud. Durand. <note place="margin">Vid.

                     <p>And theſe being all the authors which the knigth cites is this paragraffe, or at the leaſt all that deſerue anſer, we may plainelie ſee that not obſtanding all the arte and skill which he hath vſed to make them ſeeme his owne, yet the. Roman faith touching the ſeuen Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Churche ſtandes ſtill firmelie auncient, vniuerſall, and viſible, which is that he intended to deſtroy, and I maintaine.</p>
                     <p>Whence we may inferre for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion &amp; cenſure thereof, that all which our aduerſarie bringeth in it to proue that there is neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, nor vniuerſalitie in the Fathers, nor conſent in the ſchoolemen (as he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) ſufficient to shew the ſeuen Sacraments to be inſtituted by Chriſt, is meare Sophiſtrie, founded vpon his owne miſinterpretations, falſifications, and corruptions of the authours he citeth, and that conſequentlie his owne conditionall curſe is abſolutelie fallen vpon him, in which we muſt of neceſſitie leaue him
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2119:136"/> till ſuch time as by humble recantation of his errours he shall deſire abſolution.</p>
                     <p>And now hence I paſſe to the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe which is of the Communion vnder one kinde. In which the knight by a ſpeciall paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis which he makes in his 172. page, peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely perſuades his reader that the foreſaid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Communion in one kinde, was decreed as it were in diſpite of God and man by the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Conſtance, &amp; that from the time of that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion vnder both kindes was adiudged hereſie, which is not ſo, for the Roman Church doth not teach that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kindes is hereticall, but onely that it is hereſie to condemne the communion in one kinde for vnlawfull, or repugnant to Chriſts inſtitution, and ſo his poſition is both falſe and calumnious, as appeares not onely by the decree of the ſame councell, but alſo by the tenour of the decree of the Councell of Trent neither of which councels defined communion in both kindes either conformable or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to anie precept of either God or man in the nature of faith, but they onely declare the practiſe of the communion in one kinde as a thing not vnlawfull, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to Chriſts inſtitution or precept, but otherwiſe conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the preſent ſtate of the Church, in reſpect of the reuerence due to the Sacrament: <note place="margin">Si quis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerit ex Dei prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto, vel neceſsita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſalutis omnes &amp; ſingulos Chriſti fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles vtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Which doctrine is ſo plainely declared by the two foreſaid Councels and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the Councell of Trent, and ſo often repeated and inculcated by moderne diuines, (to ſay nothing of the more auncient) that if our aduerſaries were not ouer much diſpoſed to cauill they would neuer haue the face to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate the ſame by their miſconſtructions, as Sir Humfrey doth in this place. The knight cites ſome ten or eleuen Roman diuines, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them to increaſe the number he foyſteth in Caſſander, whom yet he either knowes or ought to know he is none of ours: but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not great becauſe neither he nor the reſt teach any thing here, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the doctrine of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church in this point: but they onely relate the cuſtome of the Primatiue Church to haue beene that the lay people commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in both kindes: yet not denying but that the ſame ſucceeding Church hath vpon iuſte reaſons altered that manner of communion. Yea and the ſame authours here cited defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the lawfullnes thereof either in the verie ſame or in other places of their workes: nay and

And firſt altho' Vaſquez with ſome others, is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie opinion to Taper &amp; manie other diuines to wit houlding as more probable that thoſe who receiue the Sacrament in both kindes doe receiue ſome more ſpirituall frute then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers of one alone, yet neither doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the contrarie opinion and practice, not yet doth he conclude that it is abſolutelie bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſafer for the laytie to receiue both formes
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2119:137"/> then one onelie: but rather defendes the quite contrarie expreſſelie in his 216. diſputation and laſt chapter: where not obſtanding his owne opinion defended in one of his former que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, yet he ſolues the ſectaries argument in this latter place, and ſo cleareth the difficultie of their obiection, that it is impoſſible for Sir Humfrey or anie of his confederates to gather anie thing in fauour of their poſition out of that authour, as his owne wordes doe make apparent to the reader of them, as here I place them in the margen.<note place="margin">Licet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum aliquoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opinione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedenti diſput: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendi, laici aliquo fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu priue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Salmeron is abuſed by Sir Humfrey in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde he takes onelie ſome certaine wordes of his which ſeeme to make for his purpoſe, and omits others which make againſt him which follow in the verie next leafe, and doe ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the ſenſe of the former that taking them together neither the one nor the other fauoure the reformed doctrine. For thus he ſaith.<hi>Nos enim &amp;c.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2119:138"/> here alſo of ſacriledge for her practice in thoſe caſes, as he doth our preſent Church. In which paſſage I much wonder at the ſlownes of him that otherwiſe vſeth to be ſo nimble and actiue as that in this place he tooke not paines to turne one leafe further for the diſcouerie of the truth. And the ſame I ſay of Valentia who ſpeakes iuſte to the ſame ſenſe and purpoſe <hi>de legit. vſu Euchariſtiae cap.</hi> 10. as alſo did Father Fisher and Caſtro in the places cited by our aduerſarie.</p>

Cor. 11. they neither of them diſproue communion in one kinde, as Sir Humfrey doth alledge, but expreſſelie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendit. <note place="margin">Vide S. Thom. in 3. part.</note> S. Thomas relates that the cuſtome of the auncint Church was to communicate in both formes which cuſtome he ſaith was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued euen till his dayes in ſome Churches where alſo, quoth hee, the miniſters of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar doe continuallie communicate the bodie &amp; bloud. But for danger of effuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaith he, in ſome Churches it is obſerued that the Preiſt onelie receiue the bloud, and the reſt the bodie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this, ſaith he, contrarie to the ſentence of our Lord, becauſe he that communicates the bodie, communicates alſo the bloud, ſince that Chriſt is whole in both the ſpecies or kindes euen in reſpect of both his bodie and bloud. Thus ſainct Thomas. By which it is cleare howe farre he was from patronizing

                     <p>Now touching Lyra, Sir Humfrey hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfullie omitted thoſe wordes of his, which include the verie reaſon &amp; approbation of the change which the Roman Church hath made, it being the ſame which ſainct Thomas alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in parte as his wordes in the margen declare.<note place="margin">Fit autem hic mentio de duplici ſpecie, na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiua Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia ſic da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus: ſed propter periculu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> effuſionis ſanguinis, modo da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur tantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſub ſpecie panis.

Doe plainelie either ſuppoſe or inſinuate. And for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes priuate or extraordinarie communion, he himſelfe relates diuers examples of it. So that the reader may perceiue how ſmale rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Sir Humfrey hath to vſe Caſſanders au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie for diuers reſpects in this matter, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie if he conſider his owne drift in this place, altho' I cannot denie but the ſame Caſſander leanes vnto him, in that he deſires the preſent practice of the Roman Church might be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as leſſe perfect &amp; legitimate then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, in his conceipte.</p>
                     <p>And this being all I need to ſay touching the teſtimonies of the cited authours and of Sir Humfreyes proceedings about them, I will now conclude the cenſure of this whole Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph; that directly it containeth nothing which requires ſo exacte a diſcuſſion as I haue made of it. And that I haue oftentimes mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed why the reformers should ſtand ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2119:139"/> againſt the Communion in one kinde, ſuppoſing that euen according to their owne <hi>principles,</hi> neither the words of Chriſt nor the intention of the miniſter, nor both theſe together, are of force and efficacy to make any change or alteration in the matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that when they haue ſaid and done all they can, they shall remaine bread &amp; wine as truely as if they had receaued them in the tauerne; eſpecially if we conſider yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that, according to the reformed doctrine, the intention of the miniſter is not neceſſarily required to the conſtitution of any Sacrament; and yet without the ſame it is cleerly vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceiue how the Euchariſt can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by them in remembrance of the death and paſſion of Chriſt more in both the formes of bread and wine then in one alone, eſpecially ſuppoſing that by virtue of the inſtitution and commaunde of Chriſt each of them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is to be receiued in memorie of him. And this I ſay hath cauſed me many times to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, euen yet perſuading my ſelfe the Nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts can haue no other motiue then the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their owne contentious ſpirits, to ſtand ſo nicely vpon this puntillio with the Church of Rome; which refractory proceeding of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this matter may yet ſeeme more vnreaſonable to the reader if he conſider that, altho' Vaſquez and ſome other Romane diuines are of opinion
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2119:140"/> that greater fruites of grace are reaped by the communion in both kindes then in one, yet doth it not thence followe that the communion in one kinde cannot be lawfully practized, as our Preciſians will needes haue it, nor yet that the communion vnder one kinde is but a halfe Communion, as the knight doth heere mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly inculcate; but in either of the two kinds it is moſt euident there is a perfect and intire Sacrament according to the true definition thereof, in regard there is found in either of the conſecrated formes a viſible ſigne of an inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grace inſtituted by God: as alſo becauſe the body of Chriſt euen according to the tenet of our aduerſaries being truely, really and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially receiued vnder the forme of bread onely altho' they meane onely by faith; it doth follow infallibly that vnleſſe they graunt that Chriſt can dye againe by ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his bloud from his body, or that his perfect and intire body is not there receaued but onely a part of it: it doth I ſay neceſſarily follow that vnder the forme of bread alone there is Chriſts bloud with his body, and ſo a perfect communion of them both receaued in that one kinde.</p>
                     <p>The Parahraph following is about prayer and ſeruice in an vnknowne tongue, in which point Sir Humfrey ſaith true in that he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the Roman Church celebrates Maſſe and publick ſeruice in Latin, and it is alſo true that the Councell of Trent hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2119:140"/> it not to be expedient that it be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euerie where in the vulgar language. But yet it is falſe to ſay that either the Church or Councell hath commaunded it to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in an vnknowne language; for Latin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not trulie be ſaid to be an vnknowne language, but rather it is a generall language, a knowne ſpeech, more vſed then anie one language in the world: And altho' it be not vnderſtood of the ignorant ſort of people, yet it is leſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth vnto them then anie other language ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting their owne mother tongue, yea then anie other publike language, I meane then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hebrew or greeke, and finallie it is a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage fitter for mutuall communication in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then anie other tongue, and among the more learned ſort of people of all nations, the moſt familiar of all. And I would faine knowe of the reformers what they haue to doe to call that in queſtion which hath binne generallie practiſed in the Church for manie hundred yeeres before they and their reformation were hatched. Who appointed them for iudges in this matter? Let them meddle in their owne affaires, their cauſe is not ours, we are all one both in our religion, and in the forme, and rites of our religion; we communicate with all the members of our Church euen in the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Ceremonies in what place ſoeuer they be, and they with vs. But you in England haue
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2119:141"/> built a new Church different euen from the reſt of the pretended reformed Churches of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries; you are not vniforme, neyther in doctrine nor Ceremonies, and ſo it is not amiſſe for your purpoſe that you vſe a language in your publick ſeruice in which you as little agree with your brothers as in your religion: Nay in my opinion ſuppoſing your ſeparation in communion of religion, you haue taken a politick courſe to ſeparate your ſelues alſo in the language of your ſeruice, otherwiſe it might happen vnto you and your French and dutch brothers, as it hath donne alreadie betweene the Gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mariſts and Arminians, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Arminianiſme begins to ſpred itſelfe) who are knowne to haue entered into the Church with zealous communication one with another and yet the feruour of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits hath ſo much increaſed, that before the ſermon was ended, there hath appeered good ſtore of broken pates and perhaps worſe; for auoyding of which inconueniencies our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Nouelliſts as it may be ſuppoſed haue their ſeuerall Churches and formes of ſeruice, and doctrine for themſelues, the French, and the Dutch: whereas one the contrarie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the Romane Church by reaſon of their publick ſeruice or Maſſe is in a common language, are put to no ſuch shifts, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they meet, they finde meanes to ſerue
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2119:141"/> God and to communicate together in the verie ſame manner they doe in their owne Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, whether they be old or yong, learned, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; of which great comfort the reformers by reaſon of their new forme of ſeruice in the vulgar tongue, in manie occaſions doe wilfully depriue themſelues. To ſay nothing of the dignitie which the ſeruice of God receiueth from the grauitie of the Latine tongue, and the diſparagement which it ſuffereth by a vulgar language, ſuppoſing alſo that by that meanes euen the ſecret miſteries of the Chriſtian faith come to be as familiar in the mouthes of euerie apish boy as they be to the greateſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of the Church, a thing both much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the practiſe of <hi>auncient times,</hi> and alſo which giueth great occaſion to manie to vilifie, and diſeſteeme the ſacred wordes of God included in the publike ſeruice; yea and oftentimes the thinges themſelues by the wordes ſignified, as experience doth daily teach vs: to omit the alteration &amp; corruption which it is more ſubiect vnto in a vulgar tongue then in Latine which is alwaies the ſame, as the ſame experience doth make manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>But Sir Humfrey goeth on, and tells his reader, that ſome of the Trent Bishops adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the firſt part of the decrec of the Councell to be queſtionable, for that it ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict itſelfe in that it affirmeth the Maſſe to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2119:142"/> containe much inſtruction for the faithfull, and yet commaundeth that parte of the ſeruice to be vttered with a lowe voyce, and in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, and for this, for want of better authours, he citeth the hiſtorie of the Councell of Trent. But all this is but a meere cauill grounded in the relation of a falſe hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: for that if anie ſuch thing had happened after the foreſaid decree was once confirmed, it is not ſo long a time ſince the Councell was finished, but that the fact of thoſe Bishops would haue binne knowne to the world, yea and their punishment for ſuch their temeritie, if they had remayned refractorie, would haue binne ſo published, as at the leaſt ſome one or other writer would haue taken notice of the ſame, as well as the authour of that relation: neyther is their anie contradiction in the ſaid decree, in regard it is manifeſt that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the people, the Councell meaneth eyther wholie or cheeflie the epiſtle &amp; Goſpell of the Maſſe; as alſo for that the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell withall doth expreſſelie giue Order that the Paſtours of the Church interpret and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the miſteries of the Maſſe to their pariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honers, which order taketh away all colour of contradiction which can be imagined in the wordes of the decree; eſpeciallie ſuppoſing that in what language or with what voice ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Maſſe be celebrated, the foreſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2119:142"/> will ſupplie all the obſcuritie which from thence can ariſe. But how be it this which I haue ſaid is true: yet I haue diſcouered by reading that paſſage in the foreſaid Hiſtorie, that it doth not ſo relate it, but quite in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, for that hiſtorie doth not affirme that the Tridentine Bishops made that doubt or queſtion of the decree which ordaineth the celebration of Maſſe in a lowe voyce and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne language as ambiguous in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: <note place="margin">Mandat ſancta Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoribus &amp; ſingulis curam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimarum gerentibus vt freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Trid. Seſſ. 22. cap. 8.</note> but the hiſtorie ſaith expreſſelie that the Proteſtants made that doubt by way of obiection, to which the Bishops anſered in that forme which the ſame hiſtorie relates. Which is ſo foule a falſification in Sir Humfrey that I confeſſe I had ſmale mynde to make anie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examen of the reſt of the citations of this booke if otherwiſe I had not alreadie ſo farre engaged my ſelfe. Let the reader ſuruey the 650. page of the Trid. hiſtorie printed in Latine at Franckford 1621. and he will eaſilie finde the deceipte. And now you ſee this is but a fiction of a contradiction deuiſed in diſcredit of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Councell in this point either by the knight, or ſome other Sycopha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of whome he receiued it vpon truſte. Beſides that if anie ſuch thing had happened in the time of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the doctrine of the Councell, yet certaine it is that all ſuch doubt was cleered and quite taken away by the eſtablishment of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2119:143"/> the decree itſelfe; whence it alſo appeereth how falſe a conſequence Sir Humfrey dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth out of the ſame decree, to wit that becauſe the Councell affirmeth that the Maſſe doth affoard great inſtruction to the people, and for that end ought to be interpreted vnto them, therefore ſayth the knight the Fathers of the Councell doe conſequentlie affirme that the ſeruice and prayer in the reformed Churches in the vulgar tongue was better for the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church. For it is manifeſt out of the verie ſame place cited by our aduerſarie himſelfe that the Councell of Trent doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that the Paſtours doe frequently expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſome parte of thoſe things which are read in the Maſſe, not for that it hauing decreed the contrarie, could poſſiblie hold it better to haue the Maſſe in a vulgar language then otherwiſe, but becauſe that, ſuppoſing for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it was better for the Church the Maſſe should not be in a vulgar tongue, and that beſides this, it includeth matter of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for the faithfull people, therefore the Councell prudentlie decreed not for one onelie, but for both theſe cauſes, that it should oftentimes by the Paſtours and Preiſts be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the common people for their greater edification and better vnderſtanding of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contayned in it. And this is all that in ſubſtance the Councell eyther ſayth, or from
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2119:143"/> the wordes of the decree can be trulie inferred; and ſo, that from the Romaniſts owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion it can be gathered that the ſeruice and prayer in the vulgar tongue was better for the edification of the Church, is but ſuch a dreame as Sir Humfrey vſeth to haue the night before whenſoeuer he citeth the Councell of Trent in fauour of the reformed doctrine.</p>
                     <p>After this the knight endeuoureth to proue that the Maſſe ought not to be celebrated in a ſilent and vnknowne voyce, becauſe ſayth he the Apoſtles were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to showe forth the Lords death till his comming: and to this end he citeth Haymo vpon the 14. chapter of the firſte to the Corinth, and Iuſtinian the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in Nou. Conſt. out of Caſſander, alſo the Greg. Decet. Tit. 31. de Off. Iud. Ord. cap. 14. But to this I anſwere that both the knights reaſon and the teſtimonies of theſe authours are impertinent, becauſe the command layd vpon the Apoſtles was not that in this miſterie they should shewe forth Chriſts death in words, but principallie indeedes, and therefore our Sauiour in the inſtitution of the Euchariſt did not bid his Apoſtles, ſay it in remembrance of him, but doe it in remembrance of him. <hi>Hoc facite in meam commemorationem.</hi> Otherwiſe the Sectaries themſelues should be conuinced to violate Chriſtes commaundement, ſince that thoſe who receiue their communion ſay
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:2119:144"/> not one worde. In like manner let the reader veiw and vnderſtand perfectlie the ſenſe of the the wordes cited out of other authours, and he will eaſilie perceaue there is not one ſillable in them againſt Latine ſeruice or prayer as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning it eyther for vnlawfull in itſelfe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe contrarie to the commandement of God. Haymo doth onelie comment vpon that paſſage of ſainct Paul 1. Cor 14. <hi>If I am ignorant of the virtue of the voyce, I shall be to him to whome I ſpeake barbarous,</hi> onelie declaring in playner words that which the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth breiflie and obſcurelie, but ſayth not a worde againſt the office of the Church in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. Iuſtinian (if anie ſuch conſtitution he made, of which it is much doubted, by reaſon this clauſe is not founde in the auncient tranſlation, neither is it expounded by Cuiacio) ordaineth onelie in generall that Bishops, and Preiſts ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the oblation, and miniſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Baptiſme and the Euchariſt <hi>non tacito modo not ſecretlie,</hi> but with a lowde voice; but he ſpeaketh not in particular of all partes of the Maſſe, and at the leaſt he ſpeaketh not of the Canon except he meanes of the wordes of conſecration which the Romaniſts doe not denie but the Grecians haue a cuſtome of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing them loude. And as for other partes of the Maſſe, the moſt of them are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced commonlie in the Romane Church ſo that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:2119:144"/> the auditours may heere. And according to this Iuſtinian peraduenture might aduiſe the Preiſtes of his time to doe, when neuertheleſſe it is certaine the Maſſe was in no vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The decretalls ſpeake not of anie vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue but onelie of Greeke and Latin, as, the decree of Innocent the third which may be ſeene in the ninth chap. of the Generall Councell of Lateran, doth declare. Neyther doth the Roman Church ſo ſtrictlie command that the publike ſeruice be miniſtred in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue, that she doth condemne eyther the Greeke or Syrian Church for vſing the Grecian or Caldaian tongue in the diuine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices or publike ſeruice, but onelie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as more couenient that they be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a vulgar language.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly Sir Humfrey citeth ſome eight or nine Romaniſts who confeſſe (ſayth he) that in the firſt ages publike prayers were vſed for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the people. But to omit that he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no great ſinceritie in the citation and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the teſtimonies of ſome of the authours he citeth in this paragraph, as may appeere par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie in the quotation of Waldenſis; I ſay not to ſtand here vpon this which I shall more conuenientlie examen afterwardes: I anſwere, that thoſe authours affirme that which we doe not denie, to wit, that perhaps (which worde Sir Humfrey deceitfullie leaues out in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2119:145"/> his tranſlation of S. Tho. teſtimonie cited out of his 3. lection vpon 1. Cor. 14.) <note place="margin">In 1. Cor. 14. lect. 3.</note> the caſe of the primitiue Church was different from the practiſe of the pteſent time in this matter: yet withall the ſame authours doe affirme that the alteration was made vpon iuſt cauſes, which cauſes are ſo ſufficientlie deliuered by Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and others, euen thoſe whome the knight heere citeth, that I need not rehearſe their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they being ſo eaſilie to be found as they are to thoſe that reade their bookes: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' ſainct Thomas aduertiſeth his reader, that it might haue ſeemed madneſſe in the primitiue Church to haue performed all the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call offices in the Latine tongue, for that they were rude &amp; ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the rites of the Church and ceromonies, yet doth he adde that now all are ſo well inſtructed that tho' it be in Latine, the people vnderſtands what is donne in the Church: whoſe ſaying is moſt true, at leaſt in generall yea and in particular ſo farre as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for euerie perſon, ſtate, and vocation; for that throu' the diligence of their paſtours and preachers, and their owne induſtrie, they may haue ſufficient inſtruction. Howbeit that if it were neceſſarie for euerie one that prayes or ſings to vnderſtand all they ſay, the Puritans themſelues might put vp their pipes, it being moſt certainely true that there be manie things in the pſalmes which they ſing ſo merilie, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:2119:145"/> in the ſcriptures which they read ſo readilie, <note place="margin">Conſcqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ergo Canonem clare &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perte le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vt ad gratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotis populus reſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deat, Amen.

And from hence I paſſe to a breefe Suruey of the reſt of the authors cited in this paragraph, among which I finde Caſſander in the firſt rancke of corruption: for altho' the teſtimonies which Caſſander cites doe not proue fully his intent yet is it euident by the wordes of thoſe he produceth that he ſpeakes in that places of the Canon of the Maſſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie when he ſayes in the title of his chapter <hi>canonicam precem &amp;c.</hi> And Sir Humfrey tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates it not the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Maſſe as he ought to haue done, but Canonicall prayers, ſo odious and reformidable vnto him is the reporte of that great Canon that he durſt not name it. Moreouer the teſtimonie of Caſſander is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by Sir Humfrey quite from the ſenſe in which he ſpeakes it. For he ſpeakes not there of the vulgar tongue one worde, but whether the Canon of the Maſſe ought to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a lowde voyce (eſpeciallie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration) that the people may heare it and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, Amen.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame I (or Caſſander forme me) anſer to the conſtitution of Iuſtinian which Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelfe alledges to that ſame purpoſe and in no other ſenſe. And ſo in like manner the wordes of the Decretals are violentlie drawe
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2119:146"/> to a ſenſe repugnant to the authors meaning that is from doctrinall tongues to vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
                     <p>To the wordes of Lyra, if he had dealt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerelie, Sir Humfrey ought to haue added thoſe which immediatlie enſue and explicate his minde more clearelie: <hi>Sed poſtquam populus mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicatus fuit &amp; conſueuit ſe conformare miniſtris Eccleſiae vtpote ſtando cum dicitur Euangelium depoſito caputio adorando Euchariſtiam, &amp; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia fiunt in Eccleſia Latina in Latino, &amp; ſufficit quod Clericus reſpondeat pro populo, expeditius enim fit hoc modo quam in vulgati. But ſince the people increaſed and is accuſtomed to conforme it ſelfe to the ministers of the Church, to wit by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the Goſpell, by puting of their bonet to adore the Euchariſt and ſuch like, are done in the Latine Church in Latin, and it is ſufficient that the clearke anſers for the people, for it is thus more readilie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed then in the vulgar to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue.</hi> Lyr. in 1. Cor. 14.</p>
                     <p>Which wordes are ſo plaine againſt Sir Humfrey in diuers reſpects that he may be ashamed to heare them. Belethus cited out of Caſſander to proue that ſeruice and prayer muſt be in the vulgar language, is abuſed by them both. <note place="margin">Inde etiam inoleuit v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus vel lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabilis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now if it were read in the Maſſe by the Preiſt in the vulgar tongue, then it had beene vaine for Belethus yea and impertinent to haue made mention of that cuſtome in the entrance of his worke of expounding the diuine offices for the vſe of the leſſe learned ſorte of the Clergie as he profeſſeth to vndertake. It is true he hath in the ſame paſſage that it was prohibited to ſpeake with tongues without an interpreter, but that is nothing els but the very ſame which the Apoſtle himſelfe declared 1. Cor. 14. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by tongues the miraculous ſpeech of ſtrange languages which the ſpeakers them ſelues did not vnderſtand, aboute which ſaith this author there was in the Primatiue Church a prohibition except it were with an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And this is that which by accomodation Belethus applyes to the argument of his booke by way of Prologue.</p>
                     <p>In the rehearſall of D. Hardings wordes Sir Humfrey takes onelie thoſe which teſtifie that in the Primatiue Church prayers were in the vulgar language. But he leaues out the iuſte reaſons which the Doctor alledges for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the ſame made by the authoritie of the Church euen with in the firſt foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares: as alſo he omits thoſe pregnant
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:2119:147"/> proofes which he brings to showe that ſix hundreth yeares after Chriſt the ſeruice of the Church was in no other language then in Greeke or Latine: By all which the reader may perceiue this author is not ſincerelie dealt with in this paſſage, that which yet will more plainelie appeare if he will pleaſe to ſee his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to Iewels chalenge the 3. article.</p>
                     <p>The teſtimonie of Waldenſis is vſed by Caſſander onely to proue that diuine ſeruice or Maſſe ought to be pronounced with an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible voyce that the people may anſer; Amen, but not to proue that the publike office muſt be in vulgar language, and ſo it is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
                     <p>Honorius cited by Sir Humfrey page 193. is falſified in regarde he is alledged for the cauſe of the alteration of the ancient cuſtome of the vſe of ſeruice in a knowne tongue. For that author ſpeakes not a word of the vulgar language but onely of the ſecret pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing of the Canon which was decreed, ſaith he, (I knowe not howe truely) by occaſion of a ſtrange accident which happend in times paſt touching that matter. <hi>Vnde ſinodali decreto ſub anathemate eſt praeceptum vt nullus Canonem niſi in libro &amp; in ſacris veſtibus, &amp; ſuper altare, &amp; ſuper ſacrificium legat.</hi> In which words I knowe not what linx except our Egleeyd Humfrey can ſee ſeruice in the vulgar tongue.</p>

                     <p>Gretzer is abuſed both in ſenſe and wordes. In ſenſe becauſe he ſpeakes onely of the Latin tongue and of that time when it was either vulgar or very common to manie nations: and yet the knight applyes his ſpeech to proue that publike ſeruice ought to be deliuered in the vulgarly knowne tongue of euerie nation and at all times, not contenting himſelfe with leſſe then this. In wordes he doth alſo abuſe Gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerus, for that he cites them neither intirely nor conſequenter in English, omitting or at the leaſt altering thoſe which haue relation to the authors precedent ſentence, to wit: <hi>hinc illae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortationes &amp;c.</hi> hence are thoſe exhortations of the Fathers &amp;c. and alſo others before them which he ought to haue rehearſed compleatly becauſe they are to the ſame purpoſe.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2119:148"/> where we are to examine whether the knight bringeth any ſounder matter then he hath donne heere, where (as I should haue noted before) he falſely relateth a hiſtorie of certaine shepheardes out of his falſe frend Caſſander, which shepherds he affirmeth according to his emendicated relation, to haue tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bread and wine into the body and bloud of Chriſt by pronuntiation of the words of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration which they had learned; whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the authenticall hiſtorie of that ſtrange accident written by Sophronius, ſaith onely that the bread and wine were ſuddenly burnt by fire from heauen and the shepheards ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſpeachleſſe for a time. But this howſoeuer it happened, being it can ſerue Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey for no greater purpoſe then to replenish his pages, I leaue it to the reader to conſider of this his proceeding as he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>Preſently in the entrance of the 7. Paragraph Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth a very sharpe ſentence againſt the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Trent for decreeing that due honour and veneration is to be giuen to the images of Chriſt and his Saintes, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it for a wicked and blaſphemous opinion. Loe heere the ſentence of condemnation, which is to be iudged ſo much the more rash and temerarious in reſpect the peremptorie Iudge leaueth out the greater part of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he cenſureth, which if he had added at
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:2119:148"/> large as it ſtandeth in the Councell it would ſufficiently haue iuſtified it ſelfe: and becauſe Sir Humfrey for reaſons of ſtate would not take ſo much paines, I will doe it for him.</p>
                     <p>The Councell therefore in the 25. Seſſ. page 202. decreeth in this manner, The images of Chriſt the Virgin the Mother of God and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saintes are cheifly in Churches to be had and retained, and due honour and veneration is to be giuen vnto them, not that it is beleiued there is in them any diuinity or virtue for which they are to be worshipped, or that any thing is to be asked of them, or that confidence is to be put in them, as in times paſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did who put their truſt in Idols, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the honour which is exhibited vnto ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is referred vnto the Prototipes which they repreſent, ſo that by the images which we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and before which we vncouer our heads and kneele, we adore Chriſt and reuerence the Sainctes whoſe ſimilitude they haue, that which by the decrees of councels eſpecially of the ſecond Nicene Synod hath binne eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed againſt the oppugners of images, thus the decree of the Councell of Trent; in which we finde not one word either wicked or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, nay rather euery word ſoundeth nothing but piety and religion towards Chriſt and his Sainctes, whom it will haue honoured not only in themſelues but alſo in and by their images,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2119:149"/> which manner of honour as it is declared by the Councell is not onely not contrary to ſcriptures as Sir Humfrey falſely affirmeth, but alſo very conformable to them, both in regard the ſcriptures make mention of honour due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to materiall things for the relation of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which they haue to God or other his holie creatures: <note place="margin">Pſal. 95. Matth 5.</note> as alſo for that we vſe no other reuerence to images the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church doth teach vs, whoſe authority the ſame ſcripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth and commandeth vs to follow and obey, &amp; more then this the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel is ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> attributing to images anie vnlawfull manner of honour, that it doth not once vſe either the worde worship, or adore, except where it ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Chriſt himſelfe: which wordes neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe if they be taken in the ſenſe in which diuines doe commonlie take them, include no offence at all, as ſignifying an exteriour action of honour indifferent euen according to the phraſe of ſcripture both to God and creatures, and being diſtinguished onelie according to the diuerſitie of the internall affection, and ſubmiſſion of the minde, which ſubmiſſion and affection in the honouring of an inanimate creature, as an image is, is neuer by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper exhibited to the image it ſelfe, but onelie to the thing it repreſenteth: nay <hi>nor yet</hi> the exteriour ſigne of adoration as genuflectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or inclination of the bodie, <hi>is giuen</hi> to the image
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:2119:149"/> itſelfe for itſelfe and to remaine in it, but rather by the image which we ſalute, or before which wee proſtrate our ſelues, the ſame ſigne of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is transferred ioyntelie with the affection of the mynde to the thing which is adored. Which doctrine is both ſo cleare in itſelfe and ſo plainelie declared by the Councell expreſlie teaching that the honour exhibited vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is referred to the Paterne, <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Trid. Seſſ. 25. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. de imag.</note> that a verie child may conceiue it to be free from all ſuperſtitious worship and adoration, in ſo much that it is but groſſe ignorance, malice, and madneſſe in our aduerſaries to exclaime againſt the Romaniſts as idolaters for the honour they giue to images. And I would faine knowe of Sir Humfrey or anie other of his reformed companions in what place of ſcripture this propoſition. The images of Chriſt and his ſaints are to be duelie honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: is condemned for wicked &amp; blaſphemous? and the ſame I ſay of the auncient Fathers. And if they cannot produce as much as one onelie place either out of ſcripture or Fathers which doth truelie ſerue to that purpoſe, I meane which doth truelie condemne the foreſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in that manner, as I knowe neither they nor the knight can performe, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that is cenſure of the Romaniſts is teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious and falſe, and nothing els but a reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of an old Iewish complainte againſt the Chriſtians of more auncient ages.</p>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:2119:150"/>
                     <p>It is true I knowe the reformers vſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie to alledge for their denyall of honor to images both ſcripture and Fathers as alſo Sir Humfrey doth in this paragraffe, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie they vſe to produce the wordes of that which they call the ſecond cammaundement, to wit, thou shall not make to thy ſelfe anie grauen image. But touching this I haue showed <hi>aboue</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">In the 4. Period.</note> that according to the doctrine of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin there is no ſuch ſecond commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe wordes being onelie a parte of the firſt. Secondlie, howſoeuer the matter ſtands, certaine it is that except the ſectaries will turne Iewes or Turkes they ought not to take thoſe wordes in that rigorous ſenſe which they doe, for ſo by conſequence if they tye themſelues ſo ſtrictlie to the letter of the text, they muſt doe the ſame in the commaundement of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth and ſo they will be come Sabatizing Iewes indeed. Wherefore except Sir Humfrey will turne plaine Talmudiſt, he can proue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt Chriſtians out of the foreſayd wordes.</p>
                     <p>Now touching authorities of auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he confeſſeth that hee for beareth to cite anie in particular, and what ſoeuer he falſelie pretendeth, the true reaſon was becauſe he founde none to cite except hee had produced ſuch places as they vſe onelie againſt the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie of Gentils and Ethnikes as, <note place="margin">Chamier lib. 21. de imag.</note> Daniell Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2119:150"/> and others of the reformed Doctours commonlie doe, which places neuer the leſſe ſecluding their owne gloſſes vpon them doe not in anie ſorte fauore their cauſe. And ſo Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey inſteede of Fathers hee cites Iewes and Gentils in whoſe doctrine touching this point, hee showeth himſelfe to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant then in Chriſtian writers as finding more for his purpoſe in them then in theſe, and therefore alſo as I imagin hee vſeth no other anſwere to Bellarmin affirming that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of images is not abſolutelie prohibited by the lawe of God becauſe God commaunded images to be made, the knight I ſay vſeth no other anſer then the anſer of the Iewes, to wit that God did laye a generall commaunde vpon them, and not vpon himſelfe: and ſo I ſay no more of it, but leaue to the reader to iudge howſolid and good ſuch an anſere may be, and whether it ſauoreth not much more of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme then of Chriſtian religion.</p>
                     <p>True it is hee cites diuers authours which haue writ ſince the Councel of Francford, but ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Agrippa, Eraſmus, Caſſander &amp; Chemnitius, are of no authority with vs, others are ſuſpected of corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I meane to haue ben corrupted by malignant publishers, as Polidor Virgil and Agobardus. Others are impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie alledged in regarde they eyther ſpeake onelie of the image of God himſelfe as Philo
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2119:151"/> Iudeus and S. Auguſtin, or of the manner of worship not of the ſubſtance of the honor, as Pereſius Bellarmin. Wicelius, Hincmarus: for that they eyther onelie condemne the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pictures takeing the word adoration for that kinde of honour which is due vnto God onelie, or els they ſpeake onelie of the priuate errous of ſome ſimple people: of which ſorte is Polidor &amp; Biel when they reprehend the abuſes and ſuperſtitions of ſome ſimple people, who out of ignorance giue more honour to images then eyther they ought to doe or the Church alloweth, yet doth Polidor expreſſelie approue of due honour of the ſame as his owne wordes declare euen in thoſe places where he vſeth that reprehenſion: for thus he ſaith after he had made relation of diuers images of Chriſt and his Apoſtles mentioned by Euſebius and others euen in the moſt primatiue yeares of the Church. <note place="margin">

                     <p>And as for the Emperours Valens and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:2119:152"/> whome he citeth out of Crinitus ſaying they made proclamation to all Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the images of Chriſt. It is falſe that thoſe two Emperours euer published anie decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the images of Chriſt, but expreſſelie in honour of of the ſame by eſtablishing by lawe that the image of the Croſſe of Chriſt should not be framed vpon the ground, as vpon the ſtones of ſepulchers or graues where it might eaſilie be prophaned by the feet of thoſe that paſſed ouer them, and that this is the trueth of that paſſage of thoſe two Emperours, or at the leaſt of Theodoſius, Crinitus his verie wordes would haue plainelie declared if they had not shrunke in the wetting I meane if they had ben intirelie related by the knight who is not the firſt that hath corrupted the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Theodoſius his lawe by leauing out the worde, <hi>humi,</hi> vpon the grounde for the wordes of the foreſaid lawe being thes, <hi>let not the Croſſe of Chriſt be painted vpon the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde,</hi> or ſome ſuch like, by leauing out the wordes, <hi>vpon the grounde,</hi> the ſenſe as you ſee cometh to be quite contrarie, that is the ſenſe falleth out to be this, let not the Croſſe of Chriſt be painted, which trick of the ſectaries was diſcouered long ſince by Alanus Copus in his 4. Dialogue the 11. chap. to their vtter shame and diſcredit. And yet beſides this, I maruell greatelie that either Sir Humfrey or
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:2119:152"/> his predeceſſours offer to make vſe of the foreſaid wordes of the lawe which as they are cited by him are ſo generall that they quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the practice of the reformed brothers themſelues, none or verie few of them being as yet mounted to that degree of puritie as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſelie to proclame a generall lawe againſt the pictures of Chriſt as not to be painted or grauen at all, and ſo I conclude that either thoſe wordes of the two Emperours are to be read as the Romaniſts doe vſe to read them, and then they plainelie prooue the reuerence of the Croſſe to haue beene practized in auncient times: or if they be to be read ſo generallie as the ſectaries will haue them, then if they proue anie thing, they doe no leſſe then reproue euen the Puritans themſelues and their practice in that particular.</p>
                     <p>To the teſtimonie of Tertullian whom alſo ſo the knight produceth l. de idolat. c. 5. ſaying. <hi>Thou haſt his law make thou no image.</hi> And prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie after, <hi>make no image againſt the law vnleſſe God commaunde the as he did moyſes:</hi> I anſwere firſt that if it be againſt the lawe to make anie image at all, then be theſe wordes of Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian as much againſt the reformers as the Romaniſts. For both the Church of England and all the Lutheran Churches at the leaſt, make both the images of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And I know a famous Puritan I meane
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:2119:153"/> a pure Caluiniſt (whoſe name is Daniell Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier) who expreſſelie defendes that images are not abſolutelie prohibited by that precept which he calleth the ſecond commaundement, <note place="margin">Chamier lib. 2. de imag.</note> but onelie to the end to honore them reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſlie. So that the wordes of Tertullian muſt of neceſſity be either otherwiſe tempered then they be by Sir Humfrey, or they will fall vpon his owne Church, as well as vpon the Roman Church.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I anſwere ſecondlie that <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſpeakes onelie againſt idolatrous images, or Idols, as the verie argument of his booke doth shewe, which is intituled againſt idolatrie not againſt Chriſtian images, as is manifeſtlie conuinced out of an other worke of his, <note place="margin">De Pudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citia.</note> in which he maketh expreſſe mention of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Chriſt himſelfe grauen in the chalices of his time, which he alſo me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioneth as a thing frequentlie practized: ſo that vnleſſe Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey will ſay that Tertullian plainelie contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himſelfe, he cannot poſſiblie be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to haue ſpoaken againſt the images of Chriſt and his ſaincts, but onelie againſt ſuch as the Gentils in his time, or the Iewes made in time of the old Teſtament contrary to the lawe of God as being repreſentations of falſe and fained gods and godiſſes as is owne wordes in his booke aboue cited plainelie teſtifie, where thus he diſcourſeth againſt the Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,

Thou shalt not haue ſtrange Gods beſides mee. And. Thou shalt not make to thy ſelfe anie ſemblance, or anieli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes &amp;c. Thou shalt not adore them nor ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. them, and manie o her things like to theſe which ſo debarre vs from altars, &amp; likeneſſes, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde vs ſooner to dye them to contaminate our faith of God with ſuch impieties.</hi> And afterwardes he addes. <hi>It is cleare that theſe things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by men which haue a falſe opinion of God
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2119:154"/> &amp;c.</hi> Thus origen aboute the end. By whoſe owne wordes the reader may euidentlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, he diſcourſeth onelie againſt the images and altars of falſe Gods. Which authors wordes I did therefore ſo largely relate that he himſelfe might demonſtrate howe much he is abuſed both by Caſſander and Sir Humfrey touching this matter. And indeed I haue often times much wondered to ſee the great ſtupiditie of the ſectaries in this point, and eſpeciallie the moſt learned ſorte of them, in they be either ſo ſotishlie ignorant or ſo Iewishlie ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and blind, that they are not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguish betweene the honour which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians giue to the picture of Chriſt true God and man, and the worship which the Gentils giue to the images of their imaginarie and counterfeit Gods. Not ceaſing either in their ſermons or ordinarie diſcourſes to compare moſt groſſelie the one with the other, and to pronounce ſentence of idolatrie againſt them both a like, and applying moſt abſurdelie vnto the condemnation of the reuerence which the Romaniſts vſuallie practiſe towardes the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſaid images of Chriſt and his ſaincts thoſe ſame ſentences of ſcripture and Fathers which by them were onelie ſpoken againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious errour of the Pagans, whereas in truth there is as much diſtance betwixt the one and the other as there is betwene Heauen and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2119:155"/> earth, God and the deuill, Chriſt and Belial. the perſon repreſented by the picture of Chriſt being both capable and worthie of honour, but the perſons repreſented by the images of the falſe gods being neither capable nor worthie of worship as being either wicked men or plaine deuills. And moreouer, the honour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the picture of Chriſt being not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the picture for the picture or by the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture itſelfe I meane nor without relation to the Prototipe, nor yet in the picture perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentlie, but rather to the Prototipe in and by meanes of the picture or by the picture tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torilie: not much vnlike to an arowe or darte which altho' it paſſeth by the ayre and in the ayre, yet doth it not ſtay there but in the marke onelie: whereas one the contrarie the Gentils went groſſelie to worke, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which they gaue to the ſtatues and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of their Gods the ſame they gaue to the images themſelues by themſelues and for them ſelues attributing diuinitie, or at the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine operations vnto them, and adoring them with actions of honour proper to the true God alone as ſacrifices, and the like, all which is ſo farre different not onely from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but alſo from the cogitations of anie Chriſtian man, that it can be eſteemed no leſſe then moſt groſſe ignorance in the reformers to bring it in queſtion.</p>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:2119:155"/>
                     <p>And altho' it is true that the leight of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onely is not ſufficient to eſtablish the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of images which the Councell of Trent decreed as the knight doth captiouſly inferre out of the wordes of a moderne diuine whom he citeth: neuertheleſſe the leight of nature doth ſufficiently teach vs the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene true and idolatrous worship of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and doth alſo plainely dictate vnto vs that thoſe are both ignorantly blinde who are not able to conceiue it, and temerarious and rash who not being able to conceiue it, condemne it as contrary to the lawe of God, our as ſectarie commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly doe. And thus much for the anſwere to the teſtimonie of Tertullian and to shewe that antiquity is neither for the reformers nor againſt the Romaniſts in this matter, as the knight doeth vanely indeuour to prooue, but expreſſely for them in regard that as I haue shewed out of the ſame authour euen in thoſe moſt pure and primatiue times ther was vſe of the picture of Chriſt, yea and of a grauen image (which is that the reformers moſt dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly impugne and exclaime againſt) and that euen in the chalices where of neceſſitie it muſt needs haue beene honoured, the ſame authour further affirming that the foreſaid image was much vſed in his time being the <hi>ſecond</hi> hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeare after Chriſt our Sauiour when ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie was not yet extinguished, which is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:2119:156"/> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uincing that it was not a thing then firſt inuented but long before eſtablished, nor offenſiue to the moſt ſincere and intire Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of thoſe prime ages as nowe it is to the Nyce noueliſts of our dayes, many of which are ſo ſuperſtitiouſly preciſe that, as an honeſt Proteſtant writer affirmeth, <note place="margin">Sir. Th. Ouerb. Caract. of a Preciſ.</note> they had rather ſee Antichriſt then the picture of Chriſt in the Church Windoe. And now let this ſuffice for a breefe Scantlin of the antiquitie of the reuerent vſe of images to omit others, as S. Auguſtin who in his booke of the Trinity cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth images religious ſignes. <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. Greg. l. 7. epiſt. 53.</note> And S. Gregory who ſpeaketh of proſtration before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is one of the greateſt actions of honour that the Romaniſts vſe to exhibit towarde any image. So that by this the reader may plainely ſee the Romaniſts want neither antiquity nor vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie for their doctrine in this point as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe the miſreformers want them both, for their pure negation of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And if they demaunde ſcriptures of vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which I alledged before, we may truely anſwere them as a graue diuine in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Synod anſwered the heretikes of that time. If they aske vs (ſaith he) in what place of ſcripture we read that the picture of Chriſt is to be honoured, we anſwere that there where we read that Chriſt himſelfe is to be honoured.</p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:2119:156"/>
                     <p>And if nowe the reformers demaunde of vs what reaſon we haue for the honour of the images of Chriſt and his Saincts: we may anſwer them that we haue the ſame reaſon that they haue to honore the image of their King or his deareſt fauorits. For as in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill honour, to reſpect or honore the Kings pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, doth not diminish the honour due vnto the King himſelfe, but increaſeth it ſo it paſſeth in the worship of the image of Chriſt, and if the Puritans deny this, there we leaue them as guiltie of treaſon againſt God and man.</p>
                     <p>And now here before I conclude I muſt of neceſſitie aduertice the reader of ſuch abuſes as Sir Humfrey hath committed in his citations of ſome of the authours he produceth in this place. Wherefore in the firſt place I put the two councells he alledgeth as being as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of greateſt authoritie in our aduerſaries conceipte. The one is the Councell of Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford which becauſe it is corruptedlie rehearſed by Chemintius, we may iuſtelie diſclame from it, if ther were no other reaſon. Yet Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey knowes beſides this that the Romaniſts hould that councell for illegitimate. As for the Councell of Eliberis, it is not abſolutelie reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Romaniſts, yet they knowe it was but Prouinciall conſiſting of 19. Bishops which whatſoeuer they defined in this matter which as yet is vncertaine, yet could it not be anie
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:2119:157"/> Generall doctrine or practiſe for the vniuerſall Church, but at the moſt for their owne whole Countrye as the circunſtances of that time, and place required. But of what authoritie ſoeuer they were, neither of thoſe two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels condemned the adoration of images as it is vnderſtanded and vſed in the Roman Church, for vnlawfull and much leſſe for wicked and blaſphemous as the knight here contendes: but if they truely condemned anie worship of images, it was onelie diuine not honorarie worship they condemned, and ſo they neither of them preiudicate the antiquitie and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie of the Roman doctrine in this point, and much leſſe doe they eſtablish the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie or vniuerſalitie of the miſreformed Churches, which for the moſt parte will not ſuffer anie images either painted or vnpainted to appeare in their ſinagoge, either vpon walles or windowes. And yet beſides this, it is well knowne the Councell of Nyce as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting both of Latin and Grecian Fathers, was much more generall then either the Francfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian or Eliberitan Sinod; and in the Nycene it is certaine that the honor of Images was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and eſtablished, as our aduerſarie not vnwillinglie confeſſe, and the decrees of it plainelie teſtifie; wher as in the other two it remaines doubtfull and ambiguous euen till this day what was truely deliuered in them
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:2119:157"/> touching this point, ther being onelie ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fragments of them extant touching this matter: out of all which incertaintie it is plaine that no aſſured antiquitie or vniuerſalitie can be extracted for Sir Humfreys cauſe.</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the Churches pleaſure: ſo that if Sir Humfrey had cited this author home, he could haue founde nothing to proue his poſition to wit that the doctrine of Image-honor is a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous opinion, but rather the contrarie is expreſſed ſufficiently by Clemangis, for that to ſet Images in a holie place that is in the temple
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:2119:158"/> of God, as he expreſſely affirmes the ſame Church did for moſt holeſome reaſones, is one of the greateſt acts of honour that the Romaniſts exhibite vnto them. And by this we ſe that our aduerſarie hath neither dealt ſincerelie in the alledging of this author, nor in the rehearſall of his wordes in which he paſſeth in ſilence the cheefe parte of them viz: thoſe in which he shewes that prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the primitiue Church which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones touching the placing of pictures in Churches, to haue beene onely an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call precept and changeable, yea and de facto changed by a generall Councell, as his wordes related in the margen declare. That which Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander alſo doth plainely inſinuate when in his conſultation of the vſe of images, he ſaith (tho falſely) the Fathers in the beginning of the Church did abhorre all veneration of images: yet afterwardes in the ſame treatiſe, he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes conuenient, and due honor, vnto them as in another place I will shewe by relation of his owne formall wordes. So now this being all which I need to ſpeake of this matter ſeeing that by this I haue ſaide it will manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that Sir Humfrey hath fayled both in the authenticall proofe of the antiquitie, or vniuerſalitie of his owne poſition touching the vſe of images, and in the diſproofe of ours, I
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:2119:158"/> paſſe to the next paragraph in the which doctrine of Indulgences vſed in the Roman Church is impugned by him moſt coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly by virtue of an old chalenge made in Martin Luthers dayes but as yet neuer perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, therefore let vs ſee howe our newe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion Sir Humfrey vſeth his armes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he relates the decree of the Tridentine Councell Seſſ. 25. yet in a ſome thing different manner then it runneth there. But the true te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it is this in ſubſtance: that whereas by Chriſt the power of Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces was grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to the Church &amp; that shee hath vſed that power deliuered vnto her by diuine ordinance euen in the moſt auncient times, the ſacred Synod doth teach and commaunde that the vſe of them as verie proſitable to Chriſtian people, &amp; approued by the authoritie of ſacred Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells ought to be retayned, and doth condemne thoſe with a curſe who either affirme them to be vnlawfull, or denie that there is in the Church authoritie to graunt them: this is the true tenour of the decree which Sir Humfrey hath not ſo ſincerelie rehearſed as he ought to haue done, which whether he did it to aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage his cauſe or onelie out of an ill cuſtome he hath gotte by his frequent exerciſe of ſuch trickes in diuers places of his booke, I knowe not; onelie of this I ame ſure, that he produceth nothing of anie force for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnation
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:2119:159"/> of it in all his paragraffe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he bouldlie auerreth that it will be founde (I knowe not where) that neither Chriſt nor the primatiue Fathers euer knew, much leſſe euer exerciſed ſuch pardons as are nowe daylie practized in the Church of Rome. this he affirmeth moſt ſtronglie, but proueth his affirmation ſo weakely that its hard to iudge whether his temeritie in affirming, or his defectiueneſſe in prouing that which he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, be more exceſſiue, how be it moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is that neither the one nor the other can be iuſtified, for that if he had vſed the leaſt circumſpection in the world, he might haue founde not onelie in Bellarmin, and other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines but alſo in the Councell of Trent which he citeth, mention both of ſcripture &amp; Fathers copiouſlie cited &amp; quoted for the proofe both of the power and vſe of Indulgences in the Church from time to time, of which as it ſeemes he durſt not take anie notice, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it ouer in ſilence, to the ende his greate wordes which he vttered in the beginning might carie a fairer colour of trueth, which other wiſe would preſentlie haue diſcouered themſelues to be falſe.</p>
                     <p>True it is he deſcribeth one kinde of miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or relaxation of puniſshment impoſed vpon offenders for denyall of their faith, or ſacrificing to idols, which he graunteth to haue
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:2119:159"/> beene called by the name of pardon or Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and to haue beene deriued from ſainct Paule who releaſed the inceſtuous Corinthian from the bonde of excomunication, all which tho' it be true in itſelfe, yet is it but an eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which he vſeth to the end he may with greater colour reiect thoſe pardons which are truelie and properlie Indulgences that is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation from a temporall punishment due vnto a penitent ſinner according to Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for ſatisfaction of the paine of his offenſes alreadie remitted touching the guilt and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall punishment of the ſame, by vertue of the keyes, that is by the power of bynding and looſing ſinnes which Chriſt gaue to his Church, and in her particularlie to the cheefe viſible paſtour thereof. Of the power and practize of which Kynde of pardon, if Sir Humfrey had not beene diſpoſed to cogge, he might haue found good ſtore of teſtimonies both out of ſcriptures, Councells, and Fathers alledged for the ſame by Roman diuines.</p>
                     <p>And as for ſcriptures there are two places eſpeciallie which doe plainelie enuffe conuince the foreſaid truth of Indulgences if they be reight vnderſtanded according to the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the auncient Fathers. The one is that generall ſentence of our Sauiour Math. 18. in which he giueth an illimitated power to his Apoſtles and in them to their lawfull ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:2119:160"/> for binding and looſing without anie reſtriction either to this or that one matter, or to this or that manner of remiſſion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie in that moſt generall power is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the authoritie of remitting the temporall punishment due to ſinnes which is that we call the power of Indulgences of which generall power graunted to Preiſts we haue diuers teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Fathers and particularlie of S. Aug. who vpon thoſe wordes <hi>&amp; iudicium datum est</hi> Apoc. 20.

For, my ſelfe alſo that which I pardoned, if I pardoned anie thing, for you in the perſon of Chriſt that we be not circumuented of Satam.</hi> Which wordes altho' they be obſcure in the Gramaticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, yet doe they ſufficientlie declare thoſe partes and conditions which are found in ſuch Indulgences as are now practiced in the Roman Church that is to ſay power in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator or giuer, pietie in the cauſe, and grace in
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:2119:161"/> the receiuer. S. Paule sheweth his authoritie in that he affirmeth he gaue perdon to the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Corinthian in the perſon of Chriſt that is by authoritie from him receiued: he sheweth the cauſe to haue beene the common profit of the Corinthians themſelues, to wit leaſt they should be circumuented by the deuill ſo that they in the like occaſion might fall in to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration by ouer much rigour as the inceſtuous man might haue done if he had not beene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in the performance of ſome parte of the punishment due to his offenſe. Laſtelie he in the precedent wordes sheweth the receiuer to haue beene in the ſtate of grace in that he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth his ſorowe and pennance to haue beene ſo great that he was readie to haue beene ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp by the exceſſe of it. And ſo by this we may perceiue howe deceitfullie Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey proceedeth in his 220. page where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuateth that S. Paule in the place now cited did onelie releaſe the inceſtuous Corinthian from the bonde of excomunication, whereas indeede the Apoſtle did not onelie that, but alſo did abſolue him from that temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment &amp; affliction in which if he had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he might haue conſtreined him to continue longer, and ſo ſupplyed by his authoritatiue and ſuffragatorie pardon that parte of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which otherwiſe remained to haue beene performed by the continuation of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:2119:161"/> impoſed and due to the penitent accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exaction of Gods iuſtice, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed it I ſaie by application of the merits or ſatisfactions of Chriſt, which application alſo, and not onelie the authoritie by which ſainct Paule did it, is included in thoſe wordes, <hi>in the perſon of Chriſt.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Theod. in 2. Cor. 2.</note> That which by the comen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie of Theodoret vpon this paſſage doth plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie appeere who diſcreetlie noteth that ſaint Paul is ſaid here to pardone the inceſtuous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians ſinne becauſe it was greater then his pennance. And S. Ambroſe lib. 2. de Paenit. cap. 2. ſpeaking of the ſame matter, ſaith of S. Paule: <hi>Donauit Corintho peccatum per paeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</hi> And a little after: <hi>Etenim qui de remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenda praedicauit paenitentia, debuit &amp; de ijs qui iterandum putant Baptiſmum non ſilere.</hi> By which teſtimonies of theſe two moſt famous and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authours Sir Humfreys euaſion ſaying that the Apoſtle did onelie free the inceſtuous Corinthian from the bond of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth euidentlie appeare to be falſe &amp; fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous. And thus we ſee that not onelie the relaxation of a punishment enioyned, as the knight would haue it, but alſo the ſame or very like forme of pardon which the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church vſeth at this preſent tyme, was practiced by S. Paule himſelfe in the foreſayd caſe.</p>
                     <p>And in trueth ſuppoſing at the leaſt certaine receiued maximes of diuinitie which might
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2119:162"/> eaſily be demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrated by ſcriptures if the place did ſerue for it: to wit that after the guilt of ſinne is remitted, ſome temporall punishment remaineth which according to the exigence of iuſtice muſt be remoueed before the ſoule can attaine to perfect bleſſedneſſe, either by iuſt indurance or mercifull remiſſion: and more ouer that the ſame temporall affliction which many ſuffer in this life euen after their ſinnes be intirelie remitted, is not for corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and commination onely (as the ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doe friuolouſlie contend) as appeareth plainelie in the example of Dauid who altho' he knewe from the mouth of a Prophet that the guilt of his adultry was pardoned, yet vnderſtanding neuertheleſſe by the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that ther remained no ſmale punishment behinde to wit no leſſe then the death of his deareſt child, and that as the ſcripture it ſelfe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth neither for correction nor commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely, but becauſe by his ſcandalous actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had cauſed the enimies of God to blaſpheme his name and as the text declareth in the 2. Booke of the Kings the 12. chapter, <hi>propter ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum hoc</hi> that is for this thy fact taking word for action as it is moſt frequently taken in the ſcriptures: and yet beſides all this the ſame Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid did voluntarie pennance compoſing the whole miſerere Pſalme and crying out with an <hi>amplius laua</hi> for a perpetuall teſtimony of the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:2119:162"/> ſame. And now ſuppoſing as I ſay all this, the doctrine &amp; practice of Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces now vſed by the cheefe Paſtours of the Roman Church is ſo well grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that except onely in thoſe in whom obſtinacie reigneth more then reaſon, it admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no trergiuerſation in the credibilitie and faith of it. For as God is infinitly not onely iuſt but alſo mercifull in himſelfe by eſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſo hath he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to the gouernours of his church a kind of participatiue mixture of both thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes betweene which according to that of the pſalme <hi>iuſtitia &amp; pax oſculatae ſunt,</hi> he hath made a moſt louing league to the end that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to diuers cauſes and occaſions his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall officers may ſo vſe them in earth as the vſe may be approued in Heauen, ſometimes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rigour of diſcipline for the ſatisfaction of Gods iuſtice, other times lenity for the exerciſe of his mercy.</p>
                     <p>But now touching the confirmation of this doctrine by the authority of Fathers I will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely produce the teſtimonies of Tertull. and S. Cyprian who being both ſo ancient as they are knowne to be, they may iuſtely ſerue for ſufficient witneſſes of the ancient practice of the ſame in thoſe primatiue times.</p>
                     <p>Tertullian therefore in his booke to the Martirs and firſt chapter ſpeaketh of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the paine due to ſinnes which the Bishops gaue vnto the ſinners either at the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2119:163"/> petition of martyrs, or for other cauſes, calling it by the name of peace. Which peace faith he ſome that haue it not in the Church are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to aske it of the martyrs in priſion, and therefore you alſo (meaning the Bishops) ought for that cauſe to haue, norish, and keepe it in your ſelues to the end that if perhaps you may communicate it to others. where Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian by the worde peace vnderſtandes the Bishops abſolution at the leaſt frome ſome parte of the ſinners pennance by application of the ſuperabundant ſatisfactions of the martyrs which application is alſo in the worde peace included, as manifeſtly may be gathered out of the ſame Tertullian, who afterwardes falling in to hereſie in his 22. chap. of his booke of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie recalled that which he had tought before, to wit that indult could not be giuen to thoſe that had fallen, at the petition of the martyrs, becauſe ſaith he (now turned Heretike) there remaine no ſatisfactions of martyrs, (which ſatisfactions hee calleth <hi>oleum faculae</hi>) which can ſuffice for themſelues &amp; others. All which as the reader may clearelie perceiue is nothing els in ſubſtance but ſuch an Indulgence as is now practiced by the Bishops of Rome, of whome and others by their comiſſion, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd authour doth ſpeake in the place rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame ſaith S. Cyprian in his laſt
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2119:163"/> Sermon <hi>de lapſis</hi> ſaith, <hi>paenitenti, operanti, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganti, poteſt clementer ignoſcere, potest in accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum referre quicquid pro talibus &amp; petierint mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, &amp; fecerint Sacerdotes.</hi> To the working or laboring penitent (the Bishop of whome he ſpeaketh as I ſuppoſe) may clemently pardon, &amp; accept as receiued whatſoeuer the martyrs demaunde, &amp; the Preiſts doe, or performe. And the like the ſame S. Cyp. hath l. 3. epiſt. 15. or 11.</p>
                     <p>I omit Sainct Gregorie whome yet both S. Thom. and Atiſiodorus his predeceſſour te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie to haue graunted Indulgences in forme, which altho' it is not founde in his workes now extant, yet it is farre more credible, and certaine that thoſe two authours would not haue vſed that teſtimonie with out infalible grounde that it was S. Gregories, then that it was feigned becauſe kemnitius and other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelliſts reiect it as ſuppoſitious. And if they will not admit of this teſtimonie becauſe they ſee it not. At the leaſt they muſt of neceſſitie admit of that which being yet more auncient is to be ſeeme in the Chappell of S. Croſſe of Hieruſalem in Rome written in legible letters, that S. Silueſter who was Bishop &amp; Pope aboue 1200. years paſte did conſecrate that Chappell and adorne it with maine reliquies of ſaints and indulted diuers perdons to the viſiters of it. I could alſoe cite the Popes which ſince the time of S. Greg. in ſeuerall ages haue very
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:2119:164"/> frequentlie graunted Indulgences, but becauſe I knowe our preſumptuous aduerſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne their authority (tho' iniuſtlie for that they haue ben of as great authoritie as their anticeſſours) I will ſaue the labour, and onely aduertice the reader that ther is farre greater reaſon for a prudent man to giue credit vnto them in the affirmatiue of this queſtion then there is to rely vpon the authoritie of the ſectaries for the negation, in regard that euen by their owne confeſſion the affirmatiue hath ben tought and practiced publikelie in the Chriſtian world at the leaſt for the ſpace of 400. years euen according to Kemnitius, who (tho' moſt falſely for that it may be proued That Leo the third who liued in the 8. or 9. hundreth yeare gaue pardons according to the manner of thoſe our times) affirmeth that Indulgences began aboute the yeare 1200. who neuerteleſſe on the contrary contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe graunteth that the firſt denyers of the ſame were the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> a company of pore ignorant beggarlie fellowes. From whence we may inferre how impudentlie the kinght affirmeth antiquitie &amp; vniuerſalitie in his owne Church for the denyall of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet dinying the ſame in the Church of Rome for her defence of them: ſuppoſing he could not produce as much as one authour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſſe auncient for the negatiue
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:2119:164"/> parte liuing before the pore men of lions, who hauing no other ſaint for their founder then one waldo a verie idiot, appeared aboute the yeare of our Lord 1170. that is manie hundreths of yeares after Indulgences had beene pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized in the Chriſtian world euen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme now vſed. It is true Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey alledgeth diuers Roman diuines as he vſeth to doe, but it is but a meere shift he vſeth to colour his poſition as being deſtitute of all other auncient authoritie &amp; proofe. For I haue examined thoſe authours &amp; I finde there is not one of them which is not a zelous defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both of the power which Chriſt gaue vnto the Church to graunt Indulgences, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the lawfullnes &amp; profit of them; nor doth anie one of them confeſſe the want of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie &amp; conſent of the ſame: but ſome of them onelie confeſſe indeed there is no certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netie of their beginning, or when the vſe of them came into the Church in the manner they are now vſed. To which purpoſe the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie cited out of B. Fisher may ſeeme to ſerue, who yet doth not ſay <hi>(as the knight falſelie relates)</hi> that it is not ſufficientlie manifeſt from whome Indulgences had their Originall, but he onelie ſayth <hi>non certo conſtare a quo primum tradi caeperunt, that it is not certainelie apparent who firſt began to giue them.</hi> And altho' that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath the reſt of the wordes which Sir
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:2119:165"/> Humfrey cites, yet hath he others in the ſame place which doe ſufficientlie declare his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in that manner of ſpeech; for he preſentlie addes that S. Gregorie is ſayde to haue graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Indulgences, &amp; they ſaye (ſaith he) <hi>that there was ſome moſt auncient vſe of them among the Romans which the ſtations of the Citie, giue vs to vnderſtand.</hi> And hence it is that the ſame Bishop in the ſame place turning his ſpeach to Luther his aduerſarie, ſayth vnto him, wherefore thou art a meere impoſter, or deceiuer of the people, not the Popes to whome (in this point of Indulgences) both the Goſpell fauoreth, and a generall Councell ſubſcribes, &amp; alſo the vniuerſal companie of moderne interpreters vpon thoſe wordes of Chriſt math. 16. <hi>whatſoeuer you shall bynde in earth shall be bounde in heauen, &amp; whatſoeuer you shall looſe in earth shall be looſed in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus hee.</hi> So that it is plaine that Bishop Fisher neuer duobted of the power of Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, or that the vſe of them is not lawfull or profitable, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he bring in queſtion whether the auncient Fathers &amp; diuines did denie, or not acknowledge theſe particulars, but as I ſaide before, he onelie treates of the antiquitie of the vſe of the ſame, as manifeſtlie appeares euen by the ſame wordes which the knight cites where he ſayth that, <hi>Indulgences began not till a while after the ſainte, or tremble of Purgatotie.</hi>
                        <pb n="335" facs="tcp:2119:165"/> By which alſo it doth further appeare that in his paſſage that renowned Prelate who not onelie with his pen, but alſo with his ſacred bloud defended the Roman faith as well in this as all other points, is not ſincerelie dealt with, nor pertinentlie alledged to the true ſtate of the queſtion propoſed by our aduerſarie.</p>
                     <p>Now other authours which Sir Humfrey cities, onely affirme that much can not be ſaid of Indulgences of certaintie, &amp; as vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly true ſeeing ſcriptures ſpeake not of them expreſſelie as Durand affirmes: to which purpoſe alſo Antoninus ſpeakes, &amp; yet neither of them ſay that nothing can be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with certainetie of them. Which is not contrarie to the doctrine of the Romaniſts who, altho' they beleeue there is ſufficient grounde of the power &amp; truth of them in the Bible, yet they willingly graunte with all, that diuers particulars concerning them are diſputable among diuines. And it is cleare that Durand &amp; S. Antoninus as they ſay onely that <hi>pauca</hi> fewe things can be ſayde with certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of pardons or Indulgences, &amp; that the ſcripture doth not ſpeake expreſſely of them, ſo by the ſame reaſon euident it is that the ſame authours graunte that both ſome things may be pronounced certainly of them, &amp; alſo that at the leaſt, ther is implicit &amp; vnexpreſſed mention or containement of them in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:

And as for that which Durand affirmes, that diuers of the auncient Fathers make no mention of Indulgences, yet he doth not ſay that it doth thence followe that they did reiect the power or vſe of them in the Church, &amp; much leſſe doth Durand affirme that other auncient Fathers did not mention them; yea if he had affirmed this, yet he him ſelfe kewe well enuffe that this being but a negatiue argument at the moſt, it proueth nothing. But that which followes of thoſe auncient Fathers ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in this matter, is that they had not occaſion to ſpeake of them as others had, or at the moſt, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences were not much in vſe in their tymes which doth not contradict the Romaniſts, who doe not ſtand vpon defenſe of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent vſe of them in the Primatiue Church, but of the power which they maintaine to be as auncient as the ſpirituall power of binding &amp; looſing giuen by Chriſt him ſelfe to the Paſtors of his Church in moſt generall and ample manner.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> And to this I adde that which Sir Humfrey for his owne aduantage omitted

And in deed the truth is if that authors ſentence had not ben violentlie abrupted before the end of the ſame period which he deliuered with one breath, it would haue plainelie declared that there is nothing for Sir Humfreyes purpoſe of prouing that neither Chriſt nor the Primatiue Fathers (as he ſpeaketh) euer knewe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed ſuch pardons as are now dayly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church of Rome.

For altho' Bellarmin doth inſinuate that there are not manie of the more auncient authors which make mention of Indulgences; yet he doth not affirme that there is want of antiquitie &amp; conſent in the Fathers in this matter as Sir Humfrey doth falſelie deduce out of his wordes, but onelie inſinuateth that the defect of number of the more auncient Fathers which mention Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, is ſufficientlie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the vſe &amp; cuſtome of the Church without writing, by reaſon (ſaith he) that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things are retayned in the Church by that meanes onelie.</p>

                     <p>And as for Valentia who as he is cited by the knight, relates out of S. Thomas the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome who called Indulgences a pious fraude to allure men to the performance of thoſe pious workes which are requyred in the forme of the Indulgence graunted, it is true there was ſuch a tenet in thoſe dayes: but as it is true that S. Thomas relates it, ſo is it alſo true that he conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes the ſame for verie dangerous, that which our aduerſarie if he had dealt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtlie ought not to haue omitted. And yet not obſtanding, he could not but ſee that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition cenſured by S. Thomas in the verie place cited by Valentia, as alſo he cenſureth another little better, to wit that by virtue of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence itſelfe no punishment neither in the iudgement of God, nor the Church could be remitted: notwithſtanding all this I ſaye, yet Sir Humfrey ſubtillie let it paſſe, making by that meanes his reader beleeue that the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſaid tenet was long before the dayes or Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the relation of Aquinas (as he ſaith) an vncondemned opinion of ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, &amp; reiected as erroneous by Valentia alone: who neuertheleſſe expreſſelie affirmeth it to haue beene an opinion hiſed at by all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox writers, <hi>opinio ab Orthodoxis omnibus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſa.</hi> Nay &amp; which is yet more groſſe, Sir Humfrey leaueth quite out ſome parte of the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:2119:172"/> wordes of the foreſaid opinion as it is rehearſed by Valentia, to wit thoſe which mention ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made to God by reaſon of the deuotion of the gainer of the Indulgence &amp; value of the pious workes in ioyned him for the obtaining of the ſame, all which becauſe it ſounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the doctrine of the pretenſiue refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, it ſtruct Sir Humfrey deafe one that eare, &amp; ſo he left it out.</p>
                     <p>I omit diuers particulars which our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie vtters here &amp; there in the progreſſe of his Paragraffe. Becauſe they either conſiſte of ſome inauthenticall relations aboute the vſe or rather aboute the abuſe of ſome particular graunts of Indulgences as that out of the office of Saram &amp; out of Guitcherdin: or els they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſte in his owne plaine calu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nious vntruthes, as that Indulgences are graunted onelie to drawe money frome the grainers: &amp; that the Romaniſts prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vniuerſalitie of Fathers for euerie point of faith: &amp; that the article of Indulgences wantes authoritie of ſcripture, of all this I ſaye I need to make no further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion in regarde the apparent falſitie of it doth ſufficientlie confute it ſelfe &amp; shewes that it proceeds rather frome a man malitiouſlie affected &amp; ignorant of the ſtate of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, &amp; more diſpoſed to cauille then care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to attaine to the truth of the doctrine. For ſuppoſe the abuſes were neuer ſo true (which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:2119:173"/> as in all other things ſo in this I confeſſe there haue ben ſome eſpeciallie in the queſtors or inferior adminiſtrators of Indulgences, &amp; may be more: neuertheleſſe theſe abuſes of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, doe not impeach the power, &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, &amp; lawfull vſe of the ſame, which onelie is that which my aduerſarie &amp; I haue now in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>And ſo now for concluſion of this matter we may hence inferre how impiouſlie the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries proceed in the denyall &amp; impugnation of the Indulgences vſed in the Roman Church, which altho' they had no other vtilitie or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in them then to induce people to the exerciſe of ſuch pious workes as are requyred in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of them, that is faſting, prayer &amp; almes ſo heighly commended in the ſcriptures, &amp; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacraments, yet in common reaſon ought they not to be reiected, but rather maintained &amp; ſought for with great zeale &amp; deuotion.

                     <p>VVE are now come to the 10. ſection of the booke in which Sir Humfrey produceth the teſtimonies of the Romaniſts touching the infallible certaintie of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant faith, &amp; the vncertaintie of the Romish. this is his deſigne, but I ame verily perſuaded he will fayle of his purpoſe. I will examen parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars that the truth may appeare. But before this I muſt aduertiſe the reader that in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ther is litle ſubſtance to be founde, &amp; it conſiſts cheefly in a large recapitulation of the ſuppoſed confeſſions of the Romaniſts: as that they haue confeſſed that iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is by faith onely, that the conuerſion of the bread in to Chriſts bodie, was not generally receiued by the Fathers, that the certaine &amp; definite number of Sacraments was vnknowne to ſcripture &amp; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; that the Indulgences now vſed, haue no authoritie from ſcripture or Fathers, &amp; the like all which particulars we haue allreadie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued in their ſeuerall places. In ſubſtance a great parte of it is but an idle repetition of thoſe falſities which the kingh hath vttered before, with ſome newe additions to make the number of his lyes more ample &amp; complete &amp; this he performeth with great abundance of wordes of amplification: &amp; thinking to make all ſure
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:2119:174"/> calleth to witneſſe both men &amp; Angels: And thus for ſpace of a leafe or two, he bringeth nothing but verbal diſcourſes which with the very breath of any iudicious reader preſently vanish away, &amp; ſo they need no other confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Afterwardes he comes to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which I haue not yet touched &amp; of theſe I will make a breefe examen.</p>
                     <p>And to omitte thoſe points which I haue before diſcuſſed, in his page 242. he indeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to proue out of Bellarmin that the Church of Rome hath ouerthrowne in one tenet all certaintie of true faith, &amp; he performeth it very ſolidly, becauſe for ſooth Bellarmin affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that none can be certaine by certaintie of faith that he receiueth a Sacrament by reaſon of the vncertainty of the intention of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter without which the Sacrament can not be made. And the argument the kinght framed of the doctrine of the Cardinall is this. It is a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue grounde of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can not be made without the intention of the miniſter but the intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the miniſter can not be knowne by faith, therfore the Church of Rome hath ouerthrowne in one tenet all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of true faith. I anſere firſt that altho' this is the forme which Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>freys argument muſt be reduced vnto if anie it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue, neuertheleſſe if we should examen it according to the rules of logique ther will ſcarcely be founde either
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2119:174"/> forme or figure in it, yet leaſt the knight should hould himſelfe too rigorouſly delt with as not making profeſſion of that arte, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to let that paſſe and anſwere ſecondly that I graunt the maior in this ſenſe viz. That whenſoeuer the Preiſt doth adminiſter a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament it is required that he intends at the leaſt in generall to doe that which the true Church vſeth to doe in that action I meane either formally or virtually, &amp; this is defined by the Councell of Trent as a certaine trueth. But in the minor there lyeth ſecretly a certaine falſe ſuppoſition which is this. That to the faith of a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is neceſſarilie required that the intention of the miniſter in particular caſes be knowne by faith which is not true, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the Councell; becauſe to the faith of a Sacrament is ſufficient that faith by which a Chriſtian beleeueth that euery one of thoſe viſible ſignes which the Church propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the people to be beleeued &amp; receiued as Sacraments of the new lawe are inſtituted by Chriſt to conferre grace to the receiuers, &amp; that to euery one of them is required a ſincere intention to adminiſter or performe that particular action as is was inſtituted, or as the Tridentine decreeth, <hi>intentione ſaltem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendi quod facit Eccleſia, that is at the leaſt with intention to hoe that which the Church doth; &amp;</hi> that ſeriouſly &amp; not in mockrie: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2119:175"/> it is not neceſſary that either he that performeth that ceremonie, or he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues the ſame, haue certaine knowledge of faith that this or that indiuidual Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hath ben inſtituted with the forſaid intention, but to this a morall certaintie doth ſuffice both in the miniſter &amp; in the receiuer, &amp; the reaſon is becauſe to know whether one hath receiued, or doth truely receiue a Sacrament or not, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not vpon the eſſence, or making or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Sacrament as a thing neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent vnto the conſtitution of it, but it is onely a thing conſequent or following the ſame as ſeruing onely to rectify &amp; quiete the conſciences of thoſe that either adminiſter it or receiue it, to the which as being but a morall matter, morall certainty onely is required. And ſurely if all true faith should therefore be ouerthrowne, as Sir Humfrey infereth becauſe of wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of certainty of faith in the receiuers that they receiue true Sacraments euerie time they reciue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then should it followe by an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>ad hominem,</hi> that the faith of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were alſo ouerthrowne; for that they themſelues neither haue nor can haue any ſuch certaintie of faith: or if they ſay ther is no faith of any ſuch intention of the miniſter in their religion, ſo doe we ſay the ſame of ours: for altho' it is a matter of faith in the Roman Church that the intention of the Preiſt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:2119:175"/> in generall to the conſtitution of a Sacrament, yet that intention is not neceſſarily knowne by faith in euerie particular caſe, &amp; in this conſiſteth the equiuocation of the whole argument, &amp; if the knight had diſtinguis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed between the intention &amp; the faith of the intention, he might eaſilie haue perceiued that his diſcourſe was founded vpon a falſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. To ſay nothing of the concluſion which although the premiſes were neuer ſo true, yet had they not ben able to inferre ſuch à vaſt conſequence as is the ouerthrowe of all certaintie of true faith, preciſely in reſpect of the ſuppoſed want of faith of intention aboute the Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>And now by this generall anſere may be ſolued what ſoeuer Sir Humfrey ſaith after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes of the intention required to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in particular. To which I alſon adde that if certaintie of faith were required in the receiuers of the Sacraments that as often as they receiue them, the receiue true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> &amp; that as often as they want that faith they ouerthrow all certaintie of true faith, then the reformers themſelues were in a more pitifull caſe then the Romaniſts, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde that it is vnpoſſible for them to knowne more then either by their owne ſeight, or by relation of others, that the true matter &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the Sacraments, be truelie applyed vnto
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:2119:176"/> them: &amp; yet certaine it is that vpon neither of theſe two knowledges anie ſupernaturall faith can be founded, but onely either a kynde of naturall cognitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or knowledge at the moſt, taken from the ſenſes, or a certaine morall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude proceeding from the relation of their parents or others, all which is farre inferior to the knowledge of faith as no man can denie.</p>
                     <p>That which may by a ſpeciall reaſon be yet more plainelie vrged againſt the receiuers of the Sacraments in the reformed Churches, in regarde they are ſo farre from certaintie of faith of the trueth of their Sacraments in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that they cannot poſſible haue as much as a morall certaintie of the ſame nay nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall probabilitie I meane ſuch an one as may iuſtlie moue a prudent man to giue credit, by reaſon they haue no certaintie, nor yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie of the trueth of the vocation &amp; ordination of their miniſters, without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of which two conditions, it is well knowne on both ſides, that no certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth of indiuiduall Sacraments can poſſiblie he had. And ſo we ſee that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas Sir Humfrey thought he had framed a ſtong argument againſt the doctrine of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, he onelie heapeth coles vpon his owne head. And from hence alſo we may gather an eaſie ſolution to that which he addeth againſt the neceſſitie of the Preiſts intention in ſome
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2119:176"/> of the Sacraments which he ſpecifieth as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, Order, &amp; Matrimonie.</p>
                     <p>Touching which matter I deſire the iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reader conſider whether it is not much more conformable to reaſon, to the dignity of the Sacraments, to the honour of Chriſt who inſtituted them, &amp; to the confort &amp; ſecuritie of the receiuers, that a ſincere intention of the Preiſt Gods ſubſtitute, be required to the truth &amp; due adminiſtration of them as the Roman Church doth teach &amp; ordaine: or onely ſo, that if the receiuers take them in the name of God, as the reformers ſpeake, it is ſufficient for the miniſter to performe that externall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which Chriſt did inſtitude, tho' he doeth it in ieſt or morkery as Luther teacheth, or <hi>animo illuſorio,</hi> that is with an intention or meaning to delude as kemnitius affirmeth, or to haue no intention neceſſarily required as Sir Humfrey here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth: this I ſay I leaue to the iudgement of any indifferent man to diſcerne whether the Romaniſts or the reformers proceed more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely &amp; religiouſly.</p>
                     <p>And as for the illations which the knight deduceth out of the neceſſity of the intention of the miniſter in adminiſtration of Sacraments they are ſo ignorant &amp; ſotish, as I ame asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to rehearſe them, for example when he ſayth that if the Preiſt fayles in his intention at the tyme of ſolemnization of matrimonie
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2119:177"/> the maried people liue all their dayes in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, or fornication: which is a moſt groſſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the knight: for that the Romaniſts &amp; the reformers agree in this that altho' Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie were no Sacrament, &amp; conſequentlie that the maried people should not receiue it as a Sacrament, yet were it ſufficient to free them from adulterie, in regarde they receiue it at the leaſt as a ciuill contract, whatſoeuer the Preiſts intention bee. And if it were not ſo, certainely all ſectaries of this time, &amp; particularilie Sir Humfrey himſelfe for one should liue perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallie in that damnable ſtate of adulterie which he mentioneth. And yet this ſequele I am ſure it importes him to denie as earneſtlie as he can if it be but onelie for the conſeruation of his owne, &amp; his wifes honour.</p>
                     <p>And the like foolish &amp; falſe inferences he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes aboute all the reſt of the Sacraments, as alſo aboute the ſucceſſion of the Popes &amp; paſtours of the Church as if by the confeſſion of Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts themſelues there were no certaintie in anie of them: whereas yet he himſelfe citeth Bellarmin in this verie place as teaching that in all theſe things there is at leaſt morall &amp; ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient certaintie of their reall exiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; truth. <note place="margin">

Gabriel Biel is ſo plaine for the doctrine of the Roman Church, that if the knight had not corrupted him both in wordes &amp; ſenſc, he could not haue alledged him with anie coulorable pretenſe: For in the verie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent lection to that which he cites againſt vs.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2119:178"/> Biel reſolues the queſtion in our fauor ſaying. <hi>Whence it is apparent that our prayers, &amp; hope of obtaining beatitude by the mediation of the Saints, are not voyde in Heauen: but by order conſtituted by God himſelfe; we ought to recurre to their helpe, &amp; aſsiſtance: &amp; perpetuallie implore them with due veneration that we may be ſaued by their merits.</hi> In which wordes, &amp; the reſt following, I am ſure there is ſufficient to make the author a plaine Papiſt, yea &amp; much more then Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey deſires to heare in fauor of the Roman doctrine &amp; ſo it is cleare he hath corrupted his ſenſe. And nowe for his wordes, he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe corrupted them moſt peruerſelie, by diſplaceing, &amp; tranferring them from one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to an other. For theſe wordes: <hi>non est certum per omnia:</hi> By which Biel anſers onelie to that queſtion, whether it pertaines to the accidental Beatitude of the Saints to heare our prayers (which queſtion as you ſee is onelie aboute the manner, or qualitie of the Saints vnderſtanding our petitions, not of the maine ſubſtance) he reſpondes: <hi>Non per omnia certum eſt.</hi> It is not altogether certaine. And yet Sir Humfrey applyes this, as if Biel had ſaid, that it is not certaine that the Saints heare our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at all. Yet further connecting vnto the ſame, thoſe other wordes: <hi>vnde probabiliter dicitur:</hi> Which he alſo ſoma't.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:2119:178"/> them in one ſeries, or tenor, whereas yet they are vttered by their author, manie lynes after, &amp; to an other purpoſe, where anſering to the queſtion before propoſed he ſaid thus: <hi>Vnde probabiliter dicitur &amp;c. Whence it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaid, that altho' it doth not neceſſarilie followe the beatitude of the Saints, that they heare our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: by congruitie, yet God almightie reuelles vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them all that is offered vnto them by men.</hi> All which particulars concerning the corruption of this place by the guilie knight, may more plainelie be perceiued in the author himſelfe, then I can poſſible here expreſſe.</p>
                     <p>As for the Maſter of ſentences, &amp; Scotus in the 45. d. of the fourth booke, altho' perchance they ſeeme to one that reades the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuperficiallie, not to ſpeake with certainetie of the inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, yet to the anttentiue reader it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares clearely they both ſuppoſe for certaine, &amp; of which they frame no diſputation, that the Angels, &amp; Saints heare our prayers, &amp; that we lawfullie &amp; profitablie praye vnto them, of which points it is moſt vndoubtedlie to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that thoſe two authors could not be ignorant, nor maintaine the negatiue parte, in regarde the publike letanies in which the inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints is expreſſelie included were vſed in the Church long before their dayes, as hiſtories ſo commonlie teſtifie that I need not produce them. Beſides that the writings of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2119:179"/> the ancient Fathers whoſe ſentences Peter Lombard profeſſedlie collected, as much as was for his purpoſe, &amp; of which Scotus could not be ignorant, are full of the ſame doctrine as in our Catholike Controuertiſts may eaſily appeare to the reader.</p>
                     <p>And therefore whereas the Maſter vſes the wordes: <hi>non eſt incredibile, &amp; ſcotus probabile eſt,</hi> they ſpeake not eyther of the abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of Saints, or of our prayers vnto them of which neyther of them propoſes the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: but they applye thoſe wordes to the manner onely of their vnderſtanding our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.

                        <note place="margin">In ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcondito facie Dei.</note> By which it is euident that Lombard ſpeakes onelie of the meanes by which the Saints vnderſtand the prayers of faithfull ſupplicants. And there being two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall wayes cheefelie where by the Saints may vnderſtand our prayers: the one by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:2119:179"/> of their beatitude, or beatificall viſion by which they ſee the prayers directed vnto them by ſeeing God: the other by ſpecial reuelation accidental to their bleſſedneſſe. The Maſter is of opinion, they ſee them in the worde by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their viſion of God, as I conceiue: But Scotus ſeemes to hould that, the knowlege that Saints haue of our prayers, doeth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie followe of their beatitude, but is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie accidental, &amp; by congruitie: &amp; therefore he ſayes in his anſer to the queſtion. <hi>Dico quod nrn est neceſſe ex ratione beatitudinis quod beatus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat orationes noſtras. Neque regulariter ſiue vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaliter in verbo, quia non est neceſſaria fequela beatitudinis, neque quod reuelentur, neque talis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelatio neceſſario ſequitur beatitudintm: Beatitudo enim in obiectis creatis, non tranſcendit quiditates ſeu illa quorum eſſentia viſa eſt neceſſaria ratio videndi: tamen quia congruum eſt beatum eſſe coadiutorem Dei in procurando ſalutem electi eo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do quo hoc ſibi poteſt competere, &amp; ad iſtud requiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ſibi reuelari orationes noſtras ſpecialiter quae ſibi offeruntur quia illa ſpecialiter innituntur meritis eius tanquam mediatoris perducentis ad ſalutem quae petitur, ideo probabile est quod Deus beatis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelat de orationibus ſibi vel Deo in nomine eius oblatis.</hi> That is in English. It is not neceſſarie by the nature or ſtate of beatitude that the bleſſed ſee our prayers, neyther regularlie or, vniuerſallie in the diuine worde, becauſe that
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:2119:180"/> is not anie thing which as is it were a neceſſary ſequele of beatitude. Nor that they ar reueiled becauſe neither ſuch a reuelation neceſſarilie followes bertitude: for the beatitude of the vnderſtanding in created obiects tranſcendes not the quidities, or thoſe things the ſight of whoſe eſſenſe is the neceſſarie cauſe of ſeeing. But becauſe it is congruous or conuenient that the bleſſed man be Gods cooperator in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Saluation of the elect, in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which it grees vnto him, and that to this is required that our prayers be reueiled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him eſpeciallie thoſe which are repreſented vnto him, for that they eſpeciallie are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his merits as a mediator conducting to the ſaluation which is asked. Therefore it is probable that God giues a reuelation to the bleſſed of the prayers offered to him, or to God in his name. Thus Scotus. By which it is manifeſt he onelie here diſcuſſes the diuers wayes by which according to the diuerſitie of opinions in diuinitie, the bleſſed Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnderſtandes the prayers of vs that liue in this world, houlding for probable that the knowlege which they haue of our ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto them is not by any other meanes but by reuelation from God. And in this ſenſe he ſpeakes when he ſaith <hi>probabile eſt</hi> it is probable, &amp; not becauſe he held the inuocation of Saints it in ſelfe as a matter onelie probable,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:2119:180"/> this being quite contrarie to his cited wordes as being aboute the manner of the ſaints vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding our prayers which neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes that the prayers them ſelues directed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them are lawfully made. And ſo now it clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie appeares by all theſe wordes &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that theſe two famous diuine are as ranck Romaniſts as the reſt in this particular, in regarde they call not in queſtion the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of prayer to Saints in it ſelfe but onelie the condition or qualitie of it.</p>
                     <p>And this I haue added of the doctrine of Scotus not as vſed or abuſed by my aduerſarie but onely the better to declare the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Maſter of ſentence.</p>
                     <p>And as for Caietan whome alſo Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey produceth to the ſame purpoſe, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt euen out of the wordes cited by him, that he onely ſpeaketh of ſome want of certaintie in the miracles which the Church vſeth as an argument in the Canonization of ſaints by reaſon that altho' as he confeſſeth expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely, they be moſt authenticall, yet are they not ſaith he, <hi>omnino certa</hi> altogether certaine, becauſe the credit thereof depends vpon the reportes of men. But for all this neither doth he affirme abſolutelie that miracles are the grounde wherein the Church foundes the Canonization of the ſaints (as Sir Humfrey affirmeth moſt corruptelie tranſlatinng his
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:2119:181"/> wordes omitting thoſe. <hi>Quae maxime authentica ſunt:</hi> &amp; for <hi>ab Eccleſia ſuſcipiuntur,</hi> putting in Inglish <hi>wheron the Church grounteth the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization,</hi> and detorting them to that ſenſe as the reader may clearly perceiue by conferring the tranſlation with the quotation in Latin) nor yet doth the ſame Caietan either in this or anie other place of his wordes deny either the certaintie of the doctrine of the inuocation it ſelfe, or yet the doctrine of the certaintie of the Canonization, but he onely, at the moſt, ſayth that the Church cannot receiue full, but onely humane certainty from ſuch mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles alone as she hath by relation of particular men, not euidentlie operated in the eyes of the whole Church.</p>
                     <p>And according to this we may eaſily anſwere to the ſaying of S. Auguſtin, that manie ſoules are tormented in hell whoſe bodies are hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in earth, for this S. Auguſtin ſpeakes onelie of certaine ſuppoſitious ſaints whome the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people honored for true ſaints, as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the example which the ſame S. Aug. produceth out of Sulpitius who relateth how the vulgaritie did long celebrate one for a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr who afterwardes appeared &amp; tould them he was damned. And the like is related of a diſcouerie which S. Martin made of a falſe martyr: which particular examples of errour in the common people ought not in common
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:2119:181"/> prudence to preiudicate the certaintie of the doctrine of honour due vnto ſuch as the whole Church in all ſucceeding ages hath honored for true ſaints &amp; bleſſed freinds of God. Neither doth S. Auguſtin in the cited place ſpeake to anie ſuch purpoſe of calling in queſtion the generall doctrine &amp; practice of the Church in the points of honour or inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints as may appeare by that in other places of his workes he expreſſelie auerreth the ſame as in his firſt ſermon of S. Peter &amp; Paule, &amp; in his 44. ep. where he hath thes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table wordes. <hi>In Petro quis honoratur niſi ille qui defunctus eſt pro nobis?</hi> Who is honored in Peter but he that dyed for vs? And in his 84. treatiſe vpon the goſpell of S. Iohn he ſayth. <hi>At the table we doe not ſo remember martirs as we alſo praye for them, but rather ſo that they praye for vs.</hi> And in his booke <hi>de cura pro mortuis</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 14.</note> he expreſſelie ſpeaketh of the prayer of Saints for thoſe that are buried neare vnto their tumbes. All which ſayeings of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin are plaine enuffe, &amp; yet our noble aduerſarie turnes the cat in the pan &amp; perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des his reader that he flatly denied inuocation of ſaints, but to conuince him &amp; his followes yet more plainelie I will conclude this point with the wordes of the ſame S. Auguſtin in pſal. 99. where ſpeaking of the worship of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2119:182"/> Angells againſt the Gentils, he ſayth: <hi>vtinam &amp; vos colere velletis, facile enim ab ipſis diſceretis no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> illos colere. Would to God you alſo would wosship them for you might eaſily learne of them not to wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip them.</hi> That is not to adore them as Gods but as ſaints. To this I adde that Bellarmin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth he could neuer finde the foreſayd wordes in S. Auguſtin, neither could I hauing deligently ſearched for them; euer finde them. In this ſame manner Sir Humfrey proceeds in the matter of Purgatory. For wher as S. Auguſitn in his 69. chapter of his Enchir. ſpeaking not of the exiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie but onelie of ſome particulars which are conſequent vnto it propoundeth a queſtion whether the ſoule ſeperated from the bodie be ſubiect to thoſe inordinate affections to temporall things to which shee was ſubiect when shee was united to the bodie, to which queſtion becauſe Sainct Auguſtin anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth doubtfully &amp; with vncertainetie, the kinght handleth the matter ſo nimblie &amp; cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninglie that the reader may eaſilie be perſuaded by him that S. Auguſtin was doubtfull of the exiſtence or being of Purgatorie it ſelfe &amp; ſo for the greater furtherance of this perſuation, wher S. Auguſtin ſpeaking onelie of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd queſtion ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not incredible that ſome ſuch thing should be aftfer this life, honeſt Sir Humfrey to make his market the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:2119:182"/> better <hi>foyſteth in the word Purgatory</hi> in the beginning of the ſentence as if that were it of which S. Auguſtin ſaith <hi>quaeri poteſt,</hi> it may be queſtioned, &amp; ſo deludeth his reader egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly with the falſification both of his wordes &amp; ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Some other particulars touching this ſame metter Sir Humfrey addeth partely imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent &amp; partilie falſe. Impertinent, for example, is that paſſage of his 248. page. in which he affirmes that Bellarmine ſaith it is dpubtfull whether the punishment of Purgatorie be by materiall fyre, or ſome other meanes? For what incertaintie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer there were in the Church aboute this point: yet this being I ſay not touching the paine it ſelfe but onelie the qualitie or maner of the paine, it is out of our controuerſie in this matter, which is not here of the circumſtances of Purgatorie, but of the exiſtence or being of Purgatorie it ſelfe: the manner, continuation of time, &amp; inſtruments by which the ſoules are punished &amp; the like, being left to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diuines to diſpute at there pleaſure. And ſo this allegation of Bellarmin by the knight againſt the certaintie of the Roman doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine concerning Purgatorie, is as farre out of quare as if he had alledged eyther our diuines or his owne to proue there is neyther Hell nor Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, becauſe they make diſputable queſtions
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2119:183"/> or doubts, concerning the paines of the one, &amp; glorie of the other.</p>
                     <p>And yet beſides this, it is not true that Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine makes any ſuch doubt of the materialitie of the fire of Purgatorie, but he expreſſely auerres that the common ſentence of diuines is for it. Adding that it is not in deed a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith, becauſe it is in no place defined by the Church. Yet ſaith he, it is a moſt probable opinion (beſides other reaſons he alledges) in regarde of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the Scolaſtikes, which cannot be contemned without temeritie. And now ſuppoſing the Cardinal ſpeakes ſo plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie: Sir Humfrey proceeded not ſincerelie in that he inſinuates the contrarie by a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue citation of his wordes.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie he falſely affirmeth that S. Greg. gaue the firſt <hi>Credo</hi> to Purgatorie, &amp; that he learned it by reuelations, inſinuating alſo that the Roman Church groundeth the faith of Purgatory vpon the ſpirits &amp; apparitions of dead men, which is all falſe &amp; calumnious, for that neither S. Gregorie nor any other Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts euer founded anie doctrine of faith vpon ſuch groundes, but onelie at the moſt, vſe them for confirmation &amp; illuſtration of thoſe arguments which are founded in ſcripture for that purpoſe as their writings make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
                     <p>And that S. Gregorie was not the firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2119:183"/> or gaue the firſt <hi>Credo</hi> (as the knight ſpeakes) to Purgatorie, it is manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by the teſtimonies of ſuch Fathers as liued long before him, &amp; make expreſſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. And to omit others yet more aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, S. Gregorie Nyſſen in his oration of the dead, hath theſe plaine wordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Non poterit à corpore egreſsus diuinitatis particeps fieri niſi maculas animo immixtas purgatorius ignis abſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerit.</hi> The departed can not be partaker of the diuinitie, vnleſſe purgatorie fyre take away the ſpots reſiding in his ſoule. adding after wordes: <hi>alijs poſt hanc vitam purgatorio igne materiae labes abſtergentibus.</hi> Others clenſing after this life the corruption of the matter with purgatory fyre. I indeed finde theſe words ſmat different in an other tranſlation, as alſo the wordes of an other pregnant place of the ſame author to the ſame purpoſe in his prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent page aboute the mideſt of the oration: but the ſenſe is the ſame in all places &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</p>
                     <p>S. Auſtin alſo in the 16. of his 50. homilies ſaith thus. <hi>Qui temporalibus paenis digna geſſerunt per ignem quendam purgatorium tranſibunt, de quo Apoſtolus ait<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaluus erit ſic tamen quaſi per ignem.</hi> Thoſe who haue done things deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing temporall paines, shall paſſe by a certaine purgatorie fyre, of which the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>he shall be ſaued, yet ſo as it were by fire.</hi> So that
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2119:184"/> all this which the kinght vtters of S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is friuolous, &amp; vntrue, as theſe teſtimonies conuince.</p>
                     <p>Onelie one place which Sir Humfrey ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out of S. Auguſtin, carieth ſome more apparence then the reſt. Where in his booke <hi>de vanitate ſaeculi</hi> the firſt chapter he ſaith thus. Knowe that when the ſoule is ſeparated from the bodie, preſentlie it is either placed in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe for it good workes, or caſt headlong in to the bottome of hell for it ſinnes. To which I ſay Firſt, that booke attributed to Sainct Auſtin is not founde in the Index of his ſeuerall workes collected by Poſſidonius nor cited by Beda in his commentarie vpon the Apoſtles of S. Paule conſiſting of the ſentences of S. Aug. Wherefore it is noted by Bellar. de ſcrip. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. not to be his: yet becauſe it is printed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his workes &amp; perhaps compoſed by ſome ancient author: I anſwere Secondlie that ſuppoſe it is his worke yet S.

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:2119:185"/> which Sir Humfrey vſeth in the citation of this place of S. Auſtin traſlating thoſe words <hi>pro meritis bonis: for his good merits, his good works,</hi> flying from the worde merit out of his Purita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſpirit as a beare doth from the ring.</p>
                     <p>Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey paſſeth to proue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie of Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces &amp; honour of images by the teſtimonies of the Romaniſts, but the trueth is none of them proue anie vncertainlie amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Romaniſts touching the ſubſtantiall points themſelues, for all the authours which he citeth here for this purpoſe doe vniformelie conſent in both thoſe particulars of exhibition of honour to images, &amp; aboute the power &amp; lawfullneſſe of the vſe of Indulgences as wee haue showed before.</p>
                     <p>And onelie ther is ſome vncertainlie in that which is not determined by the Church, as for example how farre Indulgences are extended, &amp; aboute the begining of the practiſe, what maner of honour is due to images, &amp; the like, which queſtions are out of the ſubiect of this ſection the title of which is, if Sir Humfrey remembreth, of the certainlie of the reformers faith, &amp; vncertainlie of the Romish faith, &amp; not of ſuch diſputable queſtions as the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts in the cited places ſpeake of. Wher alſo it is to be noted by the way that the kinght <hi>ahuſeth S. Thomas,</hi> firſt in that he affirmeth him to teach that the image of Chriſt is to be
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:2119:185"/> adored with diuine honour. For although it is true that S. Thomas ſayth that ſeeing that Chriſt is adored with adoration of latria, it is conſequent that his image is to be adored with adoration of <hi>Latria:</hi> neuertheleſſe the ſame S. Thomas addeth afterwardes, <hi>non propter ipſam imaginem, ſed propter rem cuius imago eſt,</hi> meaning that altho' both Chriſt &amp; his image be adored with the ſame externall action of diuine honour which he calleth adoration of <hi>Latria,</hi> yet is not the Latria it ſelfe or diuine honour in ſpirit &amp; truth attributed or exhibited to the picture, but onelie to Chriſt himſelfe by reaſon of his diuinitie, which diuinitie as S. Thomas knew it not to be truelie &amp; reallie in the picture, ſo knew he alſo that diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship ought not to be giuen to the ſame not as much as by accident, but onelie that the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall adoration, or externall action of <hi>Latria</hi> or the matter of it was ſo to be exhibited to the image that the formall parte ther of, that is the affection of the mynde ought wholelie to be caſt vpon Chriſt himſelfe repreſented by the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie I ſay that the knight abuſeth S. Thomas in that he calleth him the founder of image worship, whereas yet he himſelfe had cited the ſeuenth Synod immediately before which vſeth the ſame terme of <hi>adoration,</hi> and that which is more the foreſayd Synod is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:2119:186"/> by Sir Humfrey in another place for <hi>the authour of idolatrie,</hi> which neuertheleſſe was celebrated ſome hundreths of yeares before Sainct Thomas of Aquin was borne. And altho' this doctrine of his is ſome what obſcure in the termes which he deliuereth it, &amp; ſoundeth har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shelie in the eares of the common people, yet as it is true in the ſenſe he ſpeaketh it, ſo may it alſo be ſo explicated by paſtours, &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that euen children themſelues may be capable of it, eſpeciallie if firſt they be tould in generall that no picture is to be honored by it ſelfe, without relation, or reference to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype, or thing it repreſents, or for itſelfe; &amp; that whenſoeuer they exhibit anie act of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour towardes an image, they muſt withall fixe their mynde &amp; affection vpon that onelie which it repreſenteth, referring the whole action finallie &amp; laſtelie not to the picture, but to the thing pictured: euen as they doe who bowe or make courtiſie to a man whome they ſalute &amp; honour by touching his garment (as the fashion in ſome places) in which action of honour altho' the exterior ſigne is directed as well to the apparell as to the man him ſelfe, or rather more immediatelie to the apparell then to the perſon, yet the internall affection of the ſaluter is ſettled vpon the perſon onelie where finallie it ſtayeth &amp; remayneth. An ſo it is in the worship of the images of Chriſt &amp; his
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:2119:186"/> Saints, in which there is no more daunger or showe of idolatrie then there is danger of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of ciuill reuerence towardes him whoſe garment is honored in the manner before deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed. And according to this if Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey &amp; his blynde mates had but light of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to conceiue it, they should not need to feare anie danger of idolatrie in the Romaniſts, tho' they were neuer ſo ignorant, or ſimple, but thoſe might more iuſtlie feare ſpirituall idolatrie in themſelues who doe ſo much adore the Idol of their owne priuate ſpirit that they will not yeald to the iudgement of the moſt vniuerſall Church, and to thoſe who are both farre more in number, &amp; incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parablie farre more learned &amp; religious then all the impugners of honor due to the images of Chriſt and his Saints.</p>
                     <p>And yet vpon ſuppoſition of this ſame falſe idol of his owne conceite that all kynde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce done to any kynde of image is idolatry, Sir Humfrey doth moſt shamefullie calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate <hi>Gregorius de Valentia</hi> affirming him to maintaine that there is a kynde of lawfull ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. Whereas the foreſaid learned diuine onelie ſayth that a man might not obſcurelie gather out of S. Peters wordes in his firſt epiſtle chapter 34. verſ. 3. that he inſinuateth that ſome worship of images to wit, of ſacred ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is lawfull, &amp; reight, by reaſon that ſainct
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:2119:187"/> Peter ſpeaking againſt idolatrie, he calleth it not abſolutelie worship of images, but vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worship of images, <hi>illicitos ſimulacrorum cultus.</hi> Which diſcourſe of Valentia how well grounded it may ſeeme, I will not diſpute. But this I aſſure my ſelfe that defence of idolatrie was ſo farre from the toughts of that pious man (as plainelie appeareth by the reſt of his doctrine euen in the place cited) that if Sir Humfrey either had not beene verie full of corrupted meaning, or had not had great want of matter for the finishing of his falſe dealing in this ſection, &amp; for his laſt <hi>plaudite</hi> there in, hee would not haue had the face to abuſe ſo much the innocencie of ſo ſincere a writer. Eſpeciallie conſidering that altho' Valentia had committed ſuch a groſſe errour as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende ſome kynde of Idolatrie to be lawfull, yet had his errour ben wholelie impertinent to proue the vncertaintie of the Romish faith in the doctrine of honour of images, which is the point here in controuerſie; of which Valentia being knowe not to haue euer doubted in anie parte of his workes, whatſoeuer orher abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie he might be ſuppoſed to haue taught in that matter, it can not argue anie diſagreement from the reſt of the Romaniſts in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                     <p>The knight alſo citeteth Bellarmin &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus But I haue before ſufficientlie declared
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:2119:187"/> their meaning in an other occaſion, and as for Canus, he by laboring to eſtablish his owne ſingular opinion that matrimonie is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but onelie a ciuill contract except it be celebrated by a Preiſt with ſacred &amp; ſolemne wordes as he is an Eccleſiaſticall miniſter, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie alledgeth the vncertaintie of the doctrine of diuines touching the determinate matter, &amp; forme of that Sacrament, and aboute the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it giueth grace, or rather when it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth grace &amp; when it doth not, by reaſon he holds it vncertaine amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g diuines whether it be a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or not, except in thoſe caſes in which it is celebrated by the Preiſt, &amp; by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence he holdes it vncertaine among diuines whether in thoſe occaſions it conferres grace to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, which he will not haue for a matter of faith, nor yet more then the more common opinion, <note place="margin">

                     <p>THIS Period shall conteine the eleuenth ſection of the knights booke, in which. He indeuoreth to proue by the teſtimonies of his aduerſaries that there is greater benefit, confort &amp; ſaftie of the ſoule in his faith, then in the Romish. And this his taske he beginneth with great grauitie ſaying that he proceeds from the certaine way to the ſafe way. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which poſition neuertheleſſe if one were diſpoſed to proceed according to rigour of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, he might eaſilie demonſtrate a plaine impoſſibilitie in it by an argument <hi>ad hominem.</hi> For if as Sir Humfrey houldes there is no certaintie in the Romish faith &amp; way, &amp; that all the certaintie is in his owne as he hitherto hath labored to shewe, then can he not truelie ſay that his way is the ſafer way, for that the worde ſafer inuolueth a compariſon betweene two which are both ſafe, becauſe a compariſon as Philoſophie teacheth, cannot be but betwixt things of the ſame common nature, <hi>comparatio non eſt niſi inter resciuſdem generis.</hi> Wherefore ſince that according to the tenet of Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:2119:188"/> there is neyther certaintie nor ſafetie in the Romish faith, &amp; yet that, as he ſuppoſeth, they are both in his owne, it is conſequent that altho' it were a ſafe way, yet vpon his ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it cannot poſſible be truelie called either a ſafer way, or of more confort &amp; benefit then the Romish way. To ſay nothing of our knights preſumption &amp; folly in offering to call that a more ſafe, more confortable, &amp; more profitable way to the ſoule, which as yet he hath not shewed with anie probabilitie either before or now in this ſection, to haue anie one of thoſe attributes in it, but hath beene rather by mee alreadie conuinced to be voyde of them all. Ad altho' this generall anſere might ſerue for all Sir Humfrey bringeth in this place, as being in ſubſtance but a newe repetition of the ſame points of doctrine of which he treated in ſeuerall places before: yet to giue him fuller ſatisfaction, and becauſe tho' the doctrine be the ſame, yet the application is different: I will deſcend to particular examen of it.</p>
                     <p>He begins with Bellarmin whom he citeth as a confeſſer of the all ſufficientie of ſcripture as he tearmeth it, but it is as cleare as day that Bellarmin made not anie ſuch confeſſion ther being not anie ſuch worde or ſenſe to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in his workes, but rather the quite contrarie is founde euen in the ſame booke which Sir Humfrey here citeth, in which he expreſſelie
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:2119:189"/> confeſſeth &amp; profeſſeth traditions to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie beſides the ſcriptures, yea &amp; in the very-next wordes to thoſe which the knight citeth he addeth that all other things (meanig beſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des thoſe which the Apoſtles publikelie &amp; commonlie preached to all men) are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. His wordes are theſe in Latin. <hi>Dico illa omnia ſcripta eſſe ab Apoſtolis quae ſunt omnibus neceſſaria, &amp; quae ipſi palam omnibus vulgo praedicauurunt, alia autem non omnia ſcripta eſſe.</hi> I ſay that all thoſe things are written by the Apoſtles which are neceſſarie to all men, &amp; which they openlie preached to all vulgarlie or commonlie, but all other things are not written. Which laſt wordes not with ſtanding they are a parte of the ſame poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſentence, &amp; conteine the very point of difficultie in this controuerſie: yet by a notorious impoſture Sir Humfrey left them out, &amp; ſo at one ſtroake quite corrupteth both Bellarmins ſenſe &amp; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Wherfore, <hi>qui legit intelligat,</hi> he that shall read Bellarmine in the place cited by the knight, that is <hi>de verbo Dei non ſcripto lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. Will eaſilie preceiue him to be ſo farre frome the confeſſing all ſufficiency of ſcripture in that ſenſe in which the reformers take it, that the verie title of his booke, which is of the vnwritten worde, doth manifeſtlie conuince the contrarie. And as for the wordes which Sir Humfrey cited altho' we take them in that
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:2119:189"/> mangled manner in which he hath rehearſed them yet if they had ben reight vnderſtood by him, I ame perſuaded he could haue founde no iuſte coulor to produce them in fauour of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For that it is manifeſt by thoſe two limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>neceſſarie for all men, &amp; preached generally to all men,</hi> that the Cardinalls meaning could not be that abſolutelie all things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for euerie perſon or ſtate of perſons in particular, or as the logitians ſpeake, neceſſarie either <hi>pro ſingulis generum</hi> or <hi>pro generibus ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi> are written in the ſcriptures: but onely Bellarmin meant that altho' all thoſe things are written which all men both in generall &amp; in particular muſt neceſſarilie knowe, &amp; haue for the obteining of ſaluation, yet that there are ſome other things neceſſarie to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons or to ſome particular ſtates of perſons included in that generall number of all men, which are not written, as namelie aboute the Gouernment of the Church &amp; admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, &amp; in particular the Baptizme of children, &amp; the rites of the ſame, &amp; that the beptizme of Heretikes is valid. All which Bellarmin doth ſo plainelie ſpecify that it is impoſible for him that reades &amp; vnderſtands him, to doubt of this his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>And yet not vnlike to this doth Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey proceed with the ſame Bellarmin who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

Which concluſion neuertheleſſe is moſt falſe, &amp; captious, as well in regarde that according to Sir Humfreys owne confeſſion Bellarmin houldeth the ſcripture to be but a partiall rule of faith; <note place="margin">

                           </gap>age 258.</note> as alſo &amp; cheeflie becauſe when Bellarmin calleth the ſcripture <hi>a moſt certaine, &amp; moſt ſafe rule,</hi> he doth not exclude the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church or diuine tradition, but expreſſelie includeth them both as the other parte of the totall rule of faith, which ſcripture alſo, ſo onelie, &amp; not otherwiſe, he calleth with great reaſon <hi>regula credendi certiſsima &amp; tutiſsima,</hi> knowing neuertheleſſe on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie &amp; ſuppoſing for certaine that with out the authoritie of the Church &amp; traditions the ſcripture can neither be knowne to be true Scripture, not in what ſenſe it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, &amp; conſequentlie as Sir Humfrey taketh it, it is not either an all ſufficient, certaine, or ſafe rule, &amp; by &amp; an other conſequence, it can much leſſe be imagined to be a ſafer way to relie wholelie vpon the written worde as the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:2119:190"/> reformers doe then to rely vpon both the ſcriptures, &amp; the authoritie of the Church &amp; diuine traditions, as doe the Romaniſts, taking God for their Father in the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worde, &amp; the viſible Church for their mother in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, interpretation, &amp; ſenſe of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And thus wee ſee by this diſcourſe, that Sir Humfrey proueth nothing but his owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt dealing with Bellar. whom beſides that which I haue alreadie showed, he doth more then impudenlie belie in that he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him to allowe the worde of God to be but a pertiall rule of faith, which Bellarmin doth not ſay, but onelie that the ſcripture is a partiall rule, <note place="margin">Page 258.</note> not denying but the worde of God in all it latitude js a totall rule of all the Chriſtian &amp; Catholike faith, but yet ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for certaine that the ſcriptures are not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallie conuertible with the worde of God, but that they are diſtinct things the one from the other, as ta parte is from the whole which any man of common iudgement may eaſilie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. And if theſe be the trickes &amp; shifts by which Sir Humfrey meaneth to make Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min a confeſſer of his reformed religion, in ſteed of gaining him, he will looſe his owne faith &amp; credit.</p>
                     <p>The knight ſtill paſſeth on his way, &amp; tells his reader it is a ſafer way to adore Chriſt Ieſus ſitting on the reight hand of God the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:2119:191"/> Father then to adore the Sactamentall bread which depends vpon the intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Preiſt. But I tell him againe that the ſafeſt way of all is to adore Chriſt both in Heauen, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer els he is. And he himſelfe hath tould vs his bodie &amp; blood are in the Sacrament, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> if wee will not be accounted infidels wee moſt conſtantlie beleeue he is. And ſo we ſay with that moſt auncient &amp; vanerable Father Saint Cyrill of Ieruſalem, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hoc eſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum: hic eſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis meus.</hi> Math. 26. Mark. &amp; Luc. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>ſince that Chriſt himſelfe affirmeth ſo, &amp; ſaith of the bread: this is my bodie, who dareth here after to doubt of it? &amp; he alſo confirming, &amp; ſaying: this is my bloud, who can doubte, &amp; ſay it is not his bloud?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſuppoſing this his reall preſence which we Romaniſts trulie beleeue with auncient S. Cyrill &amp; the reſt of the Fethers, the ſafeſt way is to adore him in the Sacrament &amp; not as ſitting at the reight hand of his Father onelie. But as for you reformers as it can not be ſafe for you to denie Chriſts reall preſence in the Euchariſt, ſo neither is it ſafe for you to refuſe to adore him there where in the true Sacrament he is truelie preſent. I knowe Sir kinght you make your compariſon betweene the adoration of Chriſt in Heauen &amp; the adoration of the Sacramentall bread, but it proceds vpon a falſe ſuppoſition, for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts adore not the bread, but Chriſt vnder the forme of bread, whoſe exiſtence there,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:2119:191"/> doth not ſo much depend vpon the intention of the Preiſt, but that ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t certaintie may be had of the ſame &amp; at the leaſt much more then you can haue that you receiue a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whe you take the bread at the miniſters hand, who if he hath no intention to doe it as Chriſt did when he gaue it to his diſciples, then may you receiue as much at your owne table as at the communion table. But the trueth is that all this is nothing but captious cogging in Sir Humfrey; for proofe of which he moſt impertinentlie produceth S. Aug. <hi>de bono perſ. lib.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. Wher he hath not a worde to this purpoſe but onelie treateth there of the ſupernaturall actions of man, ſaying that to the end our confeſſion may be humble &amp; lowlie, it is a ſafer way to attribute them who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelie to God, becauſe although we will, yet it is God that worketh in vs to worke. All which is quite out of this matter, &amp; ſerueth for nothing but to ſtoppe holes with a vaneflorish graunded onelie vpon the wordes <hi>ſafe way</hi> which the knight founde in S. Auguſtin to ſounde to his owne tune &amp; ther vpon founded a verball argument. And the like dictionariall maner of proofe doth he vſe wherby to showe his ſafer way in the points of priuate Maſſe &amp; communion in both kyndes but moſt redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly.</p>
                     <p>For whereas he findeth in ſome of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:2119:192"/> that the Maſſe as being not onelie a ſacrifice but alſo a Sacrament is both more commendablie adminiſtred &amp; more frutfullie receiued when both Preiſt &amp; people together are partakers of it, Sir Humfrey applyeth this to the Raphſodie of the reformed Churches: which neuertheleſſe hath not a ſcrap in it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of true ſacrifice or Sacrament, but is onely a pore hungerie ſcamling of bread &amp; wine not conformable either to the forme of the ancient Lythurgies of S. Chryſoſtome or S. Baſil, nor euer heard on in the Chriſtian world before the dayes of Luther, and of ſo ſmale eſtimation euen among themſelues that if it chance to fall, they will ſcarce take paines to take it from the grounde, as may appeare by a prittie paſſage of that nature which not manie yeares paſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from the mouth of one who was then of the miniſtrie, what he is nowe I knowe not, who tould me that coming in to a certaine Church, the miniſter as he deliuered the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to his parishoners did let a peace fall from him, but there was not one in the whole congregation excepting a dogge that showed ſo much deuotion towardes their vnuenerable Sacrament as once to offer to take it from the grounde. It is true he tould me with all that the honeſt miniſter by taſting a little to often of the cup was ſome what diſtempered in his head, but that me thought was but a pore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:2119:192"/> for a man of his coate, &amp; a teacher of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed doctrine, eſpeciallie at ſuch a tyme &amp; in ſuch an occaſion. Which want of reſpect in the reformed brothers towards their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, doth yet further appeare if we compare it with the extraordinarie great diligence &amp; care which the Preiſts &amp; people vſe in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church for the auoyding of all Kynde of irreuerence towardes the holie Euchariſt as both the rubrickes of the Miſſal, the ancient Canons, &amp; dayly practice teſtifie, in ſo much that one, &amp; perhaps the cheefeſt reaſon of the reſtrainte of the Sacramentall Cup to the laytie was for the auoyding of ſuch irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerences as might eaſilie haue happened amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuch multitudes of people as vſe to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate at one tyme in the Roman Church. So that now we ſee it was great abſurditie in Sir Humfrey to argue the greater ſaftie of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his Church out of that which the Romaniſts ſpeake onelie of their owne, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie conſidering there is not one worde of ſafetie to be founde in anie of the places cited by him, the authours of them not intending to show anie leſſe ſafetie to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de either in the doctrine or practice of the Roman Church concerning priuate Maſſe &amp; ſingle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, but onelie at the moſt, that ſome more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall profit would redounde to the people then nowe doth, if either their deuotion were ſo
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:2119:193"/> farre extended as that in euerie Maſſe ſome would communicate, or that the Church, in other reſpects had greater reaſon to permit the vſe of the Chalis to the laitie then not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, alwayes ſuppoſing as a certaine trueth that not withſtanding in ſome reſpects the contrarie to that which is nowe practized might be more profitable yet, that all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidered that is the ſafeſt for mens conſciences which is done according to the preſent cuſtome of that Church which is knowne euen by our aduerſaries to haue viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſucceeded from the Apoſtles, at the leaſt perſonallie, &amp; is alſo knowne euen by Iewes &amp; gentils to be the moſt vniuerſall Church in the Chriſtian world. And let this be ſufficient to redargue the proceedings of the knight in this matter, yet not omitting that two of the authours he citeth for Romaniſts to wit the Apoſtata Deane &amp; Caſſander, are not ſuch, &amp; that in the citation of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> he vſeth one of his accuſtomed trickes, &amp; whoſe wordes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he rehearſeth them truelie in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, yet he tranſlateth them <hi>corruptedlie.</hi> For whereas Bellarmin ſaith that the Maſſe in which communicants are preſent, is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect &amp; legitimate, <hi>ex hac parte,</hi> that is in as much as it is ordained to the ſpirituall refectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people, the knight omitteth in his tranſlation the wordes <hi>ex hac parte,</hi> &amp; by that tricke doth
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:2119:193"/> notablie peruert Bellarmin's meaning, making the reader beleeue he affirmed that abſolutelie, which neuertheleſſe he did expreſſelie &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſelie vtter with limitation, with an intention to showe that altho' in one reſpect priuate maſſe is leſſe perfect, &amp; leſſe conformable to the ancient cuſtome of the Church in regarde of the profit of the people, yet that abſolutelie in it ſelfe it is as perfect &amp; lawfull as that in which communicants are preſent.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore touching the mariage of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Sir Humfrey ſayth it will appeare by the confeſſions of the Romaniſts that it is the ſafer way to liue chaſtlie in matrimony the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by a ſingle life to hazarde their ſoules by incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, thus the knight which if he meanes of the miniſters of his owne miſreformed Church onelie, I will eaſilie graunt that ſuppoſing their ſlipperie inclination to lecherie, and the ſmale meanes they vſe for mortification of the flesh &amp; conſeruation of chaſtitie, it is a ſafer way in my opinion for them to marrie then to liue a ſingle life, eſpecillie conſidering they are no true Preiſts but onelie equiuocall Clergie men both in Order &amp; function, &amp; that if they had not wiues it is to be doubted the maydes of their parishes would ſcarcelie liue with out danger among them. But if Sir Humfrey ſpeakes of Roman Preiſts which haue true vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, true ordination &amp; ſacred function, then
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:2119:194"/> I will ſay with diuers graue authors that if the Preiſts of the old teſtament obſerued thoſe dayes continencie in which they ſacrificed by their turnes, then ought the Preiſts of the new teſtament to obſerue chaſtitie euerie day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they euerie day offer ſacrifice.<note place="margin">Hier. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:2119:194"/> meanes onelie that Preiſts with ampliation, that is ſuch perſons as intend to be Preiſts may marrye if they fynde themſelues not able to liue chaſte: wher as the pretented reformers hould it lawfull not onelie for Preiſts but alſo euen for ſuch religious perſons as haue made a ſpeciall vowe of perpetuall chaſtitie, to marrie at their pleaſure, as the verie author &amp; Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignane of their ſect did both in wordes &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample teach them.

More ouer for concluſion I wish the reader to take notice that I neither fynde in Panormitan thoſe formall wordes which Sir Humfrey cites, nor anie others intyrelie equiualent vnto them, nor yet are they intyrelie &amp; continuatlie rehearſed by the knight but with interruption, as the authors owne wordes which here I truelie quote in the margen will declare.<note place="margin">

                     <p>And by occaſion of this paſſage, the reader may reflect what a pore shifte Sir Humfrey was forced to vſe for excuſe of the falacitie of his miſreformed miniſtrie when he cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at the authoritie of this one Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryphal Cardinall, who neuertheleſſe vpon due examen appeares to haue ſo much fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate his ſiniſter expectation.</p>

                     <p>Aboute prayer in an vnknowne language none of the authours the knight citeth, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that it is the ſafer way to pray in a vulgar tongue, or yet, that it is abſolutelie better, but onelie <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> that is for the edification of the Church as Caietan ſpeaketh, yet not meaning but that is the beſt &amp; ſafeſt all things conſidered which the Church doth practice: which practice as the ſame Caietan well kewe (as being a Cardinall of the Roman Church) is to haue the publike ſeruice in Latin rather then in the mother tongue for ſuch reaſons as I haue deliuered in an other place. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the teſtimonie of S. Thomas whome here the knight produceth in his commentarie vpon the 14. chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians (as I ſuppoſe, for he quotes not the place) as affirming it is manifeſt that he receiues more benefit who prayes &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandes what he ſayth, becauſe the mynde of him who prayes &amp; vnderſtandes not, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out frute &amp; refection. To this I anſer, that S. Thomas doth not meane by this that it is better that the publike ſeruice of the Church be in a vulgar language which is that wee here haue in queſtion, &amp; not the priuate prayers of euery particular perſon, of which S. Thomas onelie ſpeakes, as his owne wordes doe teſtifie
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:2119:198"/> in that place which I haue exactelie read &amp; duelie pondered. Euer ſuppoſing that manie things may be profitable for ſingle perſons which yet in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon are eſteemed much worſe yea and in ſome circumſtances abſolutelie ill, as by examples which paſſe in the lawes of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Republikes may plainelie appeare. That which S. Thomas did doubtleſſelie perſuade him ſelfe to be true whome the world knowes to haue dailie celebrated Maſſe in Latin not in anie vulgar language. To omit that euen thoſe ſimple people who praye in the Latin tongue altho' they want that particular inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the vnderſtanding which the learned receiue in prayer, yet ſans doubt they often tymes performe that action with greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion &amp; feruor in their wills &amp; affections then the greateſt ſchollers in the world: God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie by reaſon of their pious &amp; humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſupplying as it were in one power that which wantes in an other.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame I ſay to the wordes of Lyra &amp; Caietan who ſpeeches to the ſame purpoſe which S. Thomas doth &amp; vpon the ſame place of the Apoſtle 1. Cor. 14. where altho' Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan extendes his ſpeeh euen to publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church: yet is it manifeſt that the ſame Caietan doth neither condemne the contrarie practiſe of the Roman Church, nor yet houldes it abſolutelie better or ſafer that publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:2119:198"/> were (eſpeciallie in theſe our tymes) not in Latin but in the vulgar language. But he onelie meaneth that it were better in that one reſpect of edifying the Church if other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances did alſo in like paritie concurre, or if there were not more prepondering reaſons for the preſent practiſe of the Church. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore Caietan preſentlie after the wordes ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Sir Humfrey addeth others which if they had not ben omitted by him, they had quite cleared this difficultie, for ſo he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſaying. <hi>Et ne intelligeres reprehendi a Paulo eiuſmodi diuinas laudes</hi> (to wit ſuch prayers as are made in an vnknowne tongue) <hi>ſubiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git: nam tu quidem bene gratias agis:</hi> by which wordes it is plaine that Caietan was not of knight Humfrey opinion in this particular.</p>
                     <p>Laſtelie the Rhemes Teſtament cited by Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey vpon the ſame paſſage of S. Paule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the ſame that S. Thomas ſayth of a particular mans priuate deuotion, that in deed it is not ſo fruetfull for inſtruction to him when he prayes in a ſtange longuage, as when he vnderſtandes his prayers, yet the authors of the note adde an other clauſe which if the kinght had proceeded like a freind, he ought not to haue omitted, to wit that the Apoſtle forbides not ſuch praying neither: confeſſing that ſuch a mans ſpirit, harte, &amp; affection prayeth well towardes God tho' his mynde &amp;

Thus the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, Which as the reader may eaſilie perceiue doth quite contradicte Sir Humfreys purpoſe, &amp; the doctrine &amp; practiſe of his Church.</p>
                     <p>Sir Humfrey alſo falſifyes Gabriel lect. 12. in Can. or at the he leaſt he falſely &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantlie vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds him, when in his owne 265. page he cytes him, affirming that he diliuereth there ſeuen reaſons why vocall prayer should be vnderſtanded by the people, For Biel tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not there in what lenguage vocall pryer ought to bee, but onelie proueth that it muſt not be meerelie mentall but ſo vttered &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced as it may be knowne for ſuch by the people, <hi>vt innoteſcat populo,</hi> which wordes doe not ſignifie (as the kinght falſelie English them) may be vnderſtood, but may come to the notice or hearing of the people in regarde it is vocall prayer in what language ſoeuer it bee, Hebrewe, Greke, or Latin. <note place="margin">

                     <p>For the greater ſafatie of his reiecting the wiship of images he produces expreſſelie three onelie authors, two of which neuertheleſſe are no Romaniſts, one of them being the dimi-Romaniſt
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:2119:199"/> Eraſmus, the other Caſſander neither of whoſe authorities we admit for current. It is true the ſame Caſsa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der brings out of Biel ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the ſame purpoſe, who ſuppoſing he be truelie alledged, yet it muſt alwayes be true that one ſuallowe makes not ſummer, &amp; ſo what ſoeuer he ſayth his authoritie alone can not ingender ſafetie. And ſince I writ this by taking a viewe of the authors themſelues, I fynde that Sir Humfrey hath thryſe corrupted Caſſander by omiſſion of ſome of his wordes which he rehearſes out of the 979. page of his conſultation of images: for all that clauſe of Caſſander: <hi>imaginum moderato vſu pacis &amp; tranquilitatis cauſa: conſeruato:</hi> Sir Humfrey lets quyte drop out of his pen, which wordes not withſtanding are of ſo much importance to haue ben trulie related that togither with ſome others in the ſame page (which he alſo pretermits) they be the onelie wordes which moſt declare the authors meaning touching the honor due to images. The wordes are theſe. <hi>Non tamen haec quae diximus eo pertinent vt imagines ſanctorum ſi in ijs modo decorum ſeruetur non aliquo honore illis conuenienti, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito affici poſsint, videlicet ſi vt ſigna &amp; monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta ſanctorum honorifice habeantur &amp; in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam illorum quos ſignificant &amp; referunt, reuerenter conſpiciantur &amp; tractentur, modo ab eximo cultu temperetur, &amp; nihil diuinitatis &amp; virtutis illis
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:2119:200"/> tribuatur, ſed eo tantum loco habeantur quo litterae &amp; voces quae rerum abſentium quas diligimus &amp; veneramur gratam memoriam ſuggerant.</hi> All which long ſentence as being much diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Sir Humfreys Preciſian ſpirit he made shifte to paſſe ouer in lurchers ſylence. And in deed in my iudgement the foreſayd wordes taken as they ſtand in the text, are ſo plaine for the worship of images in that ſenſe in which the Roman Church houldes it lawfull to honore them, that I can not eaſilie preceiue in what they differ from the tenor of the decree of the Tridentine Councell in that point.</p>
                     <p>In the other place Sir Humfrey likewiſe omits the latter parte of Biels ſentence as it is cyted by Caſſander, &amp; as the wordes are founde in Biel himſelfe, the wordes which Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey ſcips are theſe, <hi>quia qualitercumque conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur imago est res quaedam inſenſibilis &amp; crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura cui adoratio latrie minime exhibenda.</hi> Which wordes in deed are thoſe by which both Biel &amp; Caſſander cheefelie declare what they denie to be lawfull in the due worship of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that is adoration of Latria or diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: And yet both of them graunte an other inferior worship or honor due to them, ſo that the induſtrious knight to ſaue labor falſified theſe two authors both at once. And altho' Biel doth reprehend &amp; that moſt iuſtelie, the blockish error of ſome ignorant people (of which perhaps ſome there may be ſome times in
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:2119:200"/> the vniuerſall Church) that beleeue ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine virtue or ſanctitie to reſide in images, yea &amp; in one more then an other, &amp; the like ſotish conceites, yet doth it not followe out of this reprehenſion of Biel that he denied it abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telie to be lawfull to worship images in due manner, as our captious knight would haue it: Nay Biel is ſo farre from this that in the verie ſame place quoted by Sir Humfrey he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelie defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des adoration of the images of Chriſt euen with Latria improperlie or per accidens, which is as much as anie Roman diuine graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to anie image what ſoeuer. To which we may adde that the ſame Biel doth in expreſſe termes put for <hi>concluſion</hi> of his 59. lection theſe wordes. <hi>Haec de imaginum adoratione ratione re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentationis.</hi> This of the adoration of images in reſpect of their repreſentation. By which wordes it is cleare that is author this groſſelie abuſed in that he is cited by our aduerſarie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt honor of images, he being ſo plaine a defendant of the ſame that he doubts not to vſe the words <hi>Latria</hi> &amp; <hi>adoratio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eraſmus &amp; Caſſander are alſo here produced by our aduerſarie againſt the vſe of images pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Roman Church. But theſe two altho' I doubte not but both of them in their writings incline much more to Catholike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then they doe to Proteſtancie: yet abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie they are but neutrals who followed
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:2119:201"/> more their owne wandering wits then anie other certaine rule of faith. And ſo their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies are not admitted by vs for Orthodox and authenticall. And therefore Sir Humfrey committes an error as often as he vſeth them for Romaniſts.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the ſafetie of inuocation of Saints he produceth S. Auguſtin ſaying. <hi>Tutius &amp; iucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius loquor ad meum Ieſum.</hi> But this ſentence he cites he knowes not where, and it proues he knowes not what, nor I neither. S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin truelie affirmeth that he ſpeaketh more ſafelie &amp; delighfully to Ieſus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anie other, &amp; ſo doe I, but as hee doth not ſay that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not to his Saints alſo, no more doe I. <note place="margin">Tract. 84. in Ioan.</note> And as Saint Aug. tract. 84. in Io. ſayth that wee make commemoration of the Saints at the table that is at the altar, to the end they may pray for vs, ſo doe I. the knight citeth alſo for his purpoſe Chemniſius &amp; Caſſander, but I care not for them, their teſtimonie is neither ſafe nor ſound.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the ſaftie of the doctrine of merits he citeth alſo S. Bernard ſaying that, <hi>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous is the habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe that truſt in their owne merits.</hi> But here the knight rides beſide the ſaddle, for S. Bernard ſpeakes not directlie of merits but of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in merits, which we Romaniſts grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be <hi>vnſafe</hi> by reaſon of the vncertaintie of them in this or that particular man. In an other
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:2119:201"/> place the ſame S. Ber. ſayth he duelleth in the woundes of our Sauiour with more ſaftie: which ſaying we graunte alſo to be true in the higheſt degree, but what is this to the denyall of true merits grounded in the mercie &amp; grace of God? of which the ſame <hi>S. Bernard</hi> ſayth in an other place, indeuore, or procure to haue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but when thou' haſt them acknowledge that thou haſt them giuen thee. <hi>merita habere cura, habitadata noueris.</hi> And the trueth is that by reiecting the counſell of holie S. Bernard in this particular, the reformers commit a moſt pernicious errour in regarde that by houlding all merit of man with God impoſſible, they come to neglect the exerciſe of virtue &amp; thoſe good workes in which both merit doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte, &amp; without which the Kingdome of Heauen is not obtained, which doctrine howe domageable it is to the Saluation of ſoules let the indifferent reader conſider.</p>
                     <p>Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey cytes alſo frayer walden whome he moſt <hi>falſelie</hi> affirmeth to agree with the Proteſtants in the doctrine of merits. For as appeareth by thoſe ſame wordes which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth here, he doth not denie all merit, as they doe, but at the moſt ſuch a kynde of merit in particularie: that is, that no man <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> ſimplie meriteth the Kingdome of Heauen, which merit yet he doth not abſolutelie denie, but onelie ſayth that no man can merit it but
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:2119:202"/> by the grace of God or will of the giuer, which are his owne expreſſe wordes as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe by our aduerſarie, and in a ſounde ſenſe doe not differ a iot from the doctrine of other diuines. In fine he doth with the reſt of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike diuines <hi>expreſſelie teach</hi> that the good workes of the iuſt performed by the grace of God are abſolutelie meritorious of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet he is opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the words <hi>ex condigno &amp; congruo,</hi> are not to be vſed; in which he differeth in deed from the opinion of moſt diuines, but not from the Roman faith which ſtandes not vpon thoſe termes, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon true merit, as may be ſeene in the Councell of Trent. ſeſ. 6. Can. penult. p. 48. Which Councell vſeth not thoſe tearmes, but onelie the wordes <hi>vere mereri,</hi> that is to merit truelie. And conſequentlie fryer walden agrees with the Councel of Trent but not with Sir Humfrey and his preciſe brothers who flie the verie name of merit, as deuils flie the Croſſe. And to deſcend, to a more particular diſcuſſion of fryer waldos meaning touching the doctrine of merits of which the knight ſubtillie conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to make him a flat denyer.</p>
                     <p>I ſay <hi>in primis,</hi> waldo in the place cyted by Sir Humfrey diſputes againſt Wiclef, who thought ſuch confidence in proper merits that he ſeemed to exclude the merits of Chriſt, &amp; his ſaints. And therefore ſpeaking of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:2119:202"/> tenet he ſayth thus. <hi>Maledicta ergo doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Wiclef quae potius confidere iubet in merito, &amp; hoc proprio, vt Chriſti, &amp; Sanctorum videatur excludere, quam in oratione humili pro Chriſti gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> That is: <hi>Maledicted or curſed be the doctrine of Wiclef which rather commaundes to confide in merit, &amp; that proper, ſo that it may ſeeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the merits of Chriſt, &amp; his Saints: then in humble prayer for the grace of Chriſt:</hi> Now this Kynde of confidence in merits, as our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themſelues can witneſſe if they pleaſe, is not anie parte of the Roman doctrine, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we Romaniſts concurre with fryer waldo in his approued curſſe. Yea &amp; we are ſo remote &amp; auerted from the doctrine of Wiclef in this point, &amp; from teaching ſuch confidence euen in true &amp; approued merits, that we cantelouſly aduiſe the members of our Church as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer way not to relie vpon them but vpon the mercie of God as in an other place I haue more largelie declared.</p>
                     <p>More hauing moſt atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiuelie read his ſeueral treatiſes vpon that ſubiect, I plainelie perceiue that religious, &amp; zealous defender of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doctrine againſt Wiclef, did onelie reiect ſuch merits as either excludes, or at a the leaſt preferres not the grace of God before them, or admits not grace as the foundation of merits. For touching merits founded, &amp; performed by the concourſe of Gods grace, fryer waldo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelie
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:2119:203"/> grauntes both in this ſame chapter ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our aduerſarie, where he mentiones both the merits of Chtiſt &amp; his ſaints &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie of Sainct Paule in theſe wordes. <hi>Whence it is that neyther the Apoſtle did applie anie thing to his owne merits but by premitting or preferring the benefits of God, according to the pſalmist ſaying. Becauſe he would ſo haue me.</hi> As alſo more clearelie in his tenth Title &amp; 98. chapter where he moſt profeſſedlie defendes againſt Wiclef, the verie participation of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits eſpeciallie among religious perſons. Which doctrine of participation of merits neceſſarilie ſuppoſes a graunt of merits themſelues, as common ſenſe doth eaſilie apprehend. Not to let paſſe, that ſome of the authours owne wordes in that ſame place, euidentlie conuince the ſame to be true: For that thus he queſtiones his aduerſarie. <hi>cur merita non ijs partimur quos reddimus bene meritos noſtris meritis? Why doe not we parte merits with them whome we make well merited by our merits?</hi> By which wordes waldenſis appeares to be ſo cleare from denial of merits maintained by the Roman Church, that he rather heapeth merits vpon merits in defenſe of the ſame. And in the 8. chapter of his firſt Title he ſpeakes moſt expreſſelie euen of merit of eternall life ſaying. <hi>Sed noueriut vitam aeternam dari nobis pro meritis ſi cum meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ipſis numeremus &amp; gratiam ſine qua nec ipſa
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:2119:203"/> ſunt merita, quia nec Dei dona. But let them knowe</hi> (ſayth walden) <hi>that eternal life is giuen vs for merits, if with merits we number grace, without which neyther are they merits, becauſe they are not the giftes of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And by this it further appeares moſt manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly that thoſe wordes of waldenſis alledged by Sir Humfrey &amp; with which he makes his flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, to wit. I repute him the ſounder diuine, &amp; more conſonant to ſacred ſcriptures who ſimply denyes ſuch merit: in reallitie ar not for his purpoſe, in regarde that ther is not in them anie denyal of that merit which the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church defines &amp; appooues: no not the merit of eternal life: but the author of them, onelie reiects from the deſert of eternal life <hi>tale meritum,</hi> that is merit as it is ſignified by thoſe tearmes <hi>de condigno,</hi> And, <hi>de congruo,</hi> vſed among diuines both in his time, &amp; at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: from the vſe of which according to his priuate dictamen, it were more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable both to diuinitie, &amp; the ſcripture to refraine, to the end (as he after addes) they might by the auoyding of thoſe termes, be founde both to accorde better with the former ſaints (he meanes the ancient Fathers of the Church) &amp; with the phraſe of the Apoſtle ſaying: <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.5.</note> 
                        <hi>ſufficientia noſtra ex Deo eſt: our ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie is of God.</hi> As alſo for that in reſpect of the grace of God, they might be founde more
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:2119:204"/> diſagreable (as in their doctrine ſo in their manner of ſpeech) from the Pelagians, &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſiſts who (as the ſame walden ſaith) either conceile or denie the grace of God, &amp; wholely confide in the merits of men: <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Qui gratia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dei, vel tacent vel abnega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; in meritis hominum omnino co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidunt.</hi> Ibid.</note> ſo you ſee that all the controuerſie which fryer walden hath with our Roman deuines is onelie a boute the vſe of thoſe two phraſes: <hi>meritum de condigno,</hi> and, <hi>meritum de congruo:</hi> as perſuading the foreſaid diuines that when they diſpute of merits, they neuer ſilence the grace of God, but either expreſſe grace &amp; not merits: or elſe preferre grace before meritis: and as he ſaies in Latin. <hi>exprimentes gratiam, ſilentes de meritis, aut gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam meritis praeferentes.</hi> All which is but <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stio de nomine:</hi> a nominal or verbal diſputation, or aboute what manner of ſpeech may ſeeme moſt fit to be practiſed in this point for a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding offenſe in the heares: yet walden &amp; thoſe ſame diuines vniformelie according in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the doctrine of merits themſelues as I haue ſaid once before. And ſo now let this be ſufficient to declare vnto the reader how farre out of ſquare our Croſſe aduerſarie hath detorted the true ſenſe of this religious diuine, to make him ſeeme to teache according to his owne newe diuinitie in the matter of merits. I confeſſe I haue inlarged my ſelfe much more then the matter requires: if otherwife I had not conſidered how much it importes in all
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:2119:204"/> occaſions to daunte the audaciouſnes of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous aduerſarie, who by making moſt plauſible vſe of that is leaſt for his purpoſe maintaines the ſmale reputation of his owne newfashioned religion cheefelie by the ruines of other mens honor: not ſparing this his owne renowned contriman indeuoring by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct meanes to make him ſpeak againſt his owne faith &amp; conſcience among the reſt: of which I could not poſſiblie be inſenſible: but was obliged euen according to the rules of natural affection, to labore to cleare him of ſuch a foule &amp; iniurious aſpertion.</p>
                     <p>But now I come to a concluſion, where yet the reader if he pleaſe may further take notice of ſome other more triuiall abuſe offered to this ſame famous diuine by the ſliperie knight by leauing out the aduerbe <hi>igitur</hi> in his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Latin in to English, which in reaſon he ought not to haue omitted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde it neceſſarilie implyes a relation or reference to the authors former diſcourſe in which he argues againſt merit without mention of grace, &amp; of which he ſpeakes in his ſubſequent wordes, <hi>tale meritum &amp;c.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Sir Humfrey in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie ſenſe to his meaning. Beſides this, the ſame Sir Humfrey hath not a little tranſpoſed ſome of waldens wordes in his recital of them in English. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting to theſe: <hi>or will of the giuer: thoſe, as
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:2119:205"/> all the former ſants, (vntill the late ſchoolemen) &amp; the vniuerſal Church hath written.</hi> Which neuertheleſſe, he ought to haue ſet immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telie after thoſe other which followe in the authors text: to wit: <hi>inuenirentur eſſe diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:</hi> they might be founde diſagreable. But becauſe in deed I doe not perceiue it could much importe our aduerſarie to proceed in this manner; therefore I charitablie perſuade my ſelf it was not done of malice, but rather of ill cuſtome.</p>
                     <p>Laſtelie Sir Humfrey produceth Bellarmin for the ſafety of his way in this ſame point. But he that should haue read his fift booke of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, would iudge that man fitter for Bedlam or Bridwell then for the ſchoole of diuinie, that would offer to cite Bellarmin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doctrine of merits. The wordes &amp; meaning of him I haue declared in an other place &amp; ſo hould it in diuers reſpects ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to repeate them. He cites alſo S. Auſtin out of chemnitius as it ſeemes, as ſaying (I knowe not where for he quoteth not the place) that he ſpeakes more ſafelie to <hi>Ieſus, tutius &amp; iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundius loquor ad meum Ieſum.</hi> But what is this to the purpoſe of denying inuocation of Saints. For beſides that this comes onelie out of a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers bugget &amp; ſo may iuſtelie be ſupected for falſe wares, yet admit S. Auſtin ſayth ſo, what Romaniſt is there who doth not ſay the ſame
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:2119:205"/> yea &amp; practiſe the ſame daylie in their prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> While they acknowledge with all ſubmiſſion &amp; humilitie that all their ſaftetie &amp; conforte of conſcience proceedes from Ieſus as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of their Saluation, as the concluſion of all or moſt Catholike prayers demonſtrate: Yet not ſo but that they may crye alſo vnto his freindes &amp; ſeruants as being more neare allyed vnto him both in place, fauour, &amp; merits then we our ſelues, that they interced &amp; mediate for vs for the obtaining of that which wee our ſelues are not worthy either to obtaine or craue at his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. Which kinde of inuocation of Saints, S. Auſtin himſelfe doth approue in diuers places as tract. 84. in Io. Ser. de verb. Apoſt. &amp; de cura pro mart. cap. 4. And ſo theſe being all the authors which Sir Humfrey hath produced in this ſection, I will conclude the cenſure of it in this manner. That whereas he promiſed in the begining to shewe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaftie of the Proteſtant faith then of the Roman by the confeſſion of the Romaniſts themſelues, he hath shewed no ſaftie at all, but onelie trifled in the wordes &amp; meaning of his aduerſaries doctrine, &amp; that onely in ſome fewe negatiue articles of his faith omitting all the reſt, &amp; ſo he hath performed iuſt nothing which may ſerue for the demonſtration of anie way at all, &amp; much leſſe of a ſafe &amp; perfect way, but onelie hath brought him ſelfe &amp; his reader
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:2119:206"/> further into the laberinth of his wandering wits.</p>

                     <head>THE XI. PERIOD.</head>
                     <p>IN his 12. ſection Sir Humfrey tells his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Church of Rome doth ſeeke to elude the recordes, &amp; reall proofes in the Fathers, &amp; other learned authours, touching the cheefe points in controuerſie betwixt vs. This accuſation no doubt maketh a foule noiſe in a pulpit, but let vs ſee how the knight will be able to iuſtifie it.</p>
                     <p>For his firſt witneſſe he produceth S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome <hi>Hom</hi> 49. <hi>operis imperf.</hi> where it is ſayd that, <hi>the Church is knowne onelie by the ſcriptures.</hi> But firſt the verie title of the treatiſe showeth this teſtimonie to be of ſmale authoritie as being <hi>opus imperfectum</hi> an vnperfect worke, &amp; ſo it ought not in reaſon to be admitted for a ſufficient proofe: eſpeciallie conſidering that Sir Humfrey alledgeth no other witneſſe; &amp; yet on the contrarie wee knowe that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſayd. <hi>In ore duorum, aut trium teſtium ſtet omne verbum, in the mouth of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes euerie worde may stand.</hi> And ſo ſuppoſe it were true that S. Chryſoſtome ſayd iuſt that which Sir Humfrey would haue him, yet is not one teſtimony enuffe to conuince an aduerſary, thus much I ſay for as much as concerneth the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:2119:206"/> point of controuerſie it ſelfe of the all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of ſcripture. But becauſe the knight may ſay this is not that which he intendeth directlie in this place but onelie to conuince that Bellarmin hath eluded the foreſayd teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, therefore I anſwere ſecondlie that Sir Humfrey needed not to haue gone to Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min's Chronologie for the cenſure of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſaid worke, for he might haue founde it more plainelie cenſured before in his contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, as appeareth <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de verbo Dei non ſcripto,</hi> the 11. chapter. Where the Cardinall hath theſe wordes. <hi>But this teſtimonie is not of Chryſostome but of the author of the imperfect, who was either an Arian or certainlie his booke was corrupted by the Arians in manie places:</hi> Thus Bellarmin. Shewing the corruptions by two ſeuerall inſtances taken out of the worke it ſelfe, where he ſpeaketh againſt the Homou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians that is againſt the Chriſtians of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church to which he giueth that name becauſe they defended &amp; beleeued the conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantialitie of the eternall ſonne with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; yet its well knowne that ſainct Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome neuer eyther writ or ſpoake againſt the Homouſians as being one of them himſelfe &amp; a profeſſed enimie to their aduerſaries the Arians.</p>
                     <p>And hence it is plaine that Bellarmin had reaſon to cenſure that worke &amp; not to ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:2119:207"/> it for S. Chryſoſtomes, as Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey would haue it, except he would haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned that glorious Doctour of the Church for an Arian heretike, as the reformed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers muſt of neceſſarie conſequence doe if they will haue him to be the authour of that vnperfect treatiſe. Neyther did yet Bellarmin taxe it for that ſentence which the knight al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth out of it as hee craftilie &amp; falſelie inſinuates, but for other erroneous doctrine which it containeth, which is no more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to anie article of the Roman faith, if it be trulie vnderſtood: then it is to the faith of the reformers, except perhaps they be nearer in ſome points of their doctrine to the Arians then the Romaniſts bee, whoe quite deteſte &amp; abhorre the ſame. Which I leaue to their owne conſciences to determin. For altho' the Romaniſts denie that the ſole ſcripture &amp; pure text of the bible is ſufficient to determin all controuerſies &amp; doubts in doctrine or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, yet they doe not denie but that the ſole ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth ſufficientlie declare the moſt &amp; greateſt parte of the doctrine neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, &amp; particularlie they graunt that the true Church may be ſufficientlie knowne by onelie ſcripture truelie expounded, which is the verie ſame that the authour of the imperfect affirmeth in the foreſayd wordes. Neyther is it all one to affirme that the Church is knowne onelie by ſcriptures &amp; to affirme that the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:2119:207"/> onelie hath all ſufficiencie as Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey doth falſelie ſuppoſe when he vſeth the firſt propoſition taken out of the author of the Imperfect as a medium to proue the ſecond which is his owne poſition, becauſe to know the Church onelie is not all the doctrine which the ſcripture containeth as neceſſarie to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onelie a parte of the ſame, &amp; ſo it is cleare that how true ſoeuer it be that the church is knowne by ſcripture onelie, yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it not be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce inferred that all the doctrine of the Church neceſſarie to ſaluation is ſufficientlie knowne by onelie ſcripture except out of the pregnance of his wit &amp; extrauagant skill in logique, the knight can inferre an vniuerſall propoſition out of a particular, which I know he can no more performe then he can extract by arte two oyſters out of one apple. And thus we ſee that Sir Humfrey hath not proued by the exception of Bellarmin againſt the foreſaid treatiſe, that either the Roman Church or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts haue eluded their recordes, or reall proofes of Fathers touching the queſtion of all ſufficiencie of ſcripture, for that the ſentence thence produced proueth no ſuch thing. And conſequentlie there was no neceſſitie that Bellarmin should indeuour to infringe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the whole worke for ſuch a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie drawne out of it as is not contrarie to the Roman faith, neither can it with anie cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:2119:208"/> be imagined that the Cardinall would euer haue layde his cenſure vpon the ſame if it had not ben faultie in greater matters.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie Sir Humfrey produceth ſaint Auguſtin touching the deniall of honour of Saints, where he ſayth that manie are tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the diuell who are worshipped by men on earth. And whereas Bellarmins anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, according to Sir Humfreys relation, is that peraduenture it is none of Auguſtins that ſentence, the honeſt knight as if Bellarmin were all the Romaniſts that euer writ or ſpoake, maketh a generall interrogatorie ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſay the Romaniſts to this? As if that which one onelie priuate man ſpeaketh in a priuate matter were to be accounted the voyce of all men of his profeſſion. And yet Bellarmin doth not onelie adde more in his anſere yea &amp; much more to the purpoſe, which not withſtanding our braue Sir Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant very ſlylie omittes viz. that he could not finde thoſe wordes in S. Auguſtin, but alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth three other principall anſeres to the ſame obiection. And ſo it appeareth that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of proofe that Bellarmin eludeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes of S. Auguſtin, the eluſorie knight elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des both Bellarmin &amp; his reader egregiouſlie by deceitfullie omitting that which both iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Cardinalls proceeding, &amp; alſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the true meaning of the place cited in
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:2119:208"/> ſainct Auguſtins name.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he taxeth Bellarmin &amp; ſtapleton for ſaying that S. Auguſtin was deceiued, or committed a humane errour in his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe wordes <hi>ſuper hanc Petram,</hi> cauſed by the diuerſitie of the Hebrewe, Grek &amp; Latin tongue which either he was ignorant of or marked not. But I anſere firſt that what ſoeuer error S. Auguſtin might commit in this matter, certaine it is that it was onelie aboute the interpretation of thoſe wordes <hi>Math.</hi> 16. <hi>thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke, will I build my Church</hi> For touching Sainct Peters ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authoritie in it ſelfe (which is that our irreligious aduerſarie intendes chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felie to diminish in this occaſion) it is moſt apparent that S. Auguſtin ſtronglie maintaines it in his ſecond of Baptiſme cap. 1. ſaying. <hi>Quis neſciat illum Apoſtolatus Petri principatum, cuilibet Epiſcopatui eſſe praeferendum?</hi> That is who can be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that Principalitie or ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raintie of Peters Apoſtolate is to be preferred before anie Epiſcopate or Bishoprike? And in his 15. ſermon of the ſaints, he ſpeakes yet more plaine to this purpoſe, affirming that our ſauiour did nominate S. Peter for the foundation of the Church, <hi>&amp; ideo digne funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum hoc Eccleſia colit, ſupra quod Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stici officij altitudo conſurgit.</hi> And therefore (ſaith S. Auguſtin) the Church deſeruedlie
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:2119:209"/> honoreth this foundation vpon which the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Eccleſiaſtici ſtructure ariſeth. And by this S. Auguſtins faith of S. Peters ſouera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in the gouerment of the Church moſt clearilie appeares, ſo that no other peculiar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſenſe of thoſe wordes <hi>ſuper hanc Petram,</hi> could poſſible preiudicate his owne conſtant doctrine in the ſubſtance of this matter in it ſelfe, as neither could ſtapleton or anie other Catholike diuine by their taxation of him.</p>
                     <p>And yet neither did S. Auguſtin in deed reproue the common opinion of diuines in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding that place of S. Mathewe of the perſon of S. Peter: but expreſſelie remittes the choyſe of the one or the other to the iudgement, or affection of the reader, as is manifeſt by his owne wordes vpon this ſame ſubiect in his retractions concluding his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe aboute the two ſeuerall opinions in this manner. <note place="margin">Lib. 1. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. c. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Harum. autem duarum ſententia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quae ſit probabilior eligat lector.</hi> Of theſe two opinions let the reader make choiſe of which is more probable. And ſo this allegation is nothing to the purpoſe of Sir Humfreys ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious indeuors in prouing the euident teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ancient Fathers to be eluded by Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, as being neither anie euident teſtimonie in it ſelfe, as I haue declared, nor yet within the ſphere of faith, or including the point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:2119:209"/> in the matter propoſed by our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie in this paſſage, as he falſelie ſuppoſeth: out of which compaſſe euerie one may lawfullie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde in his owne ſenſe: as well the Fathers in the deliuerie of their priuate opinions, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the moderne diuines in paſſing their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the ſame as occaſion ſerues, So it be performed with diſcretion &amp; modeſtie, as here it was by learned Stapleton, as his wordes doe shewe.</p>
                     <p>And beſides this, altho' we should admitte the foreſayd wordes of the Euangeliſt may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſelie be expounded either of our Sauiour or of ſainct Peter, or both: neuertheleſſe the Popes ſupremacie cannot ſuffer therby anie preiudice, as being ſufficientlie eſtablished both by other wordes of the ſame paſſage, &amp; by other places of ſcripture, particularlie by that of S. Iohn 21. <hi>paſce oues meas &amp;c.</hi> Feede my sheepe. Which wordes are ſo forcible for the proofe of ſaint Peters ſupreme authoritie ouer all Chriſts flocke that they alone with the circumſtances of the text, were ſufficient to conuicte anie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable perſons iudgement.</p>
                     <p>Thirdlie concerning the communion of the Cup he reprehendeth Bellarmin for ſaying in his anſwere to the wordes of S. Ignatius <hi>one cup is diſtributed to all,</hi> that in the latin bookes is not founde diſtributed to all, but for all. But firſt I ſay that why should Bellarmin be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:2119:210"/> for an eluder of the Fathers recordes for telling the trueth? or for reporting that which he did ſee with his eyes, &amp; perhaps without ſpectacles. And if it be founde by eye witneſſes to be otherwiſe in the Latin copies then in the Greeke as truelie it is, as alſo it is founde that the Greeke copies are not ſound in diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars in which they are diſcouered not to agree with the citations of S. Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius &amp; Theodoret, What ſinne did Bellarmin commit in vttering the ſame? But howſoeuer it bee good Sir Humfrey, doth Bellarmin relie onelie vpon that anſer, nay doth he not giue two other more cheefe anſers then that? both which you diſſemble. And yet more then this, you haue shamefullie <hi>corrupted that</hi> one anſere which you cite. For <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſayth not that S. Ignatius hath the wordes <hi>diſtributed for all,</hi> but, <hi>one chalis of the whole Church, vnus calix totius Eccleſiae,</hi> meaning that there is one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon chalice becauſe it is offered to God for all. Nay beſides this, Bellarmin yet further addeth, that the Magdeburgers read thoſe wordes of S. Ignatius as the Romaniſts doe, of which alſo craftie Sir Humfrey taketh no notice: ſo that the reader may ſee that Bellarmin is here diuerſlie abuſed by the falſe knight, &amp; yet is he no more guiltie of eluding of the Fathers recordes in this particular then the foreſayd Lutherans them ſelues, that is nothing at all.</p>
                     <pb n="421" facs="tcp:2119:210"/>
                     <p>Fourthlie he taxeth <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> for ſaying he ſuſpecteth Origen to haue ben corrupted by the heretikes where he ſayth: <hi>Thus much be ſpoken of the typicall &amp; ſymbolicall bodie.</hi> But what if Senenſis vtter his opinion in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that place of Origen. For doth not ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, or at the leaſt, a number of other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines giue other ſolid anſers to the ſame as may be ſeene in <hi>Bellarmin</hi> &amp; others. As that it is not certaine that workes is trulie Origens: &amp; that thoſe wordes are not ſpoaken of the Euchariſt, but of the bread of the Cathecumes which we commonlie call holie bread, that Origen tearmes the bodie of Chriſt Sybolical &amp; Typical becauſe it is preſent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a type or ſigne of the ſame bodie of Chriſt as it is vnited to the diuine worde in the myſterie of the Incarnation in a viſible ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. For in that place Origen compares the bodie of Chriſt as it is in the Sacrament with the ſame as it is in it proper exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>And ſo in like manner ſanders and Baronius for diuers reaſons hould the wordes cited by Caluin out of the epiſtle of Epiphanius to Iohn of Hieruſalem touching the cutting of a vayle with an image of Chriſt, or ſome other man, which he founde at the entrance of a Church; for ſuppoſitious as being added after the whole epiſtle was ended. And yet notobſtanding, they relie not intirelie vpon this anſwere, but
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:2119:211"/> yeald others alſo which, ſuppoſing the foreſayd addition were truelie the wordes of that holie Father, yet thoſe ſame authors abundantly cleare the difficultie &amp; declare the trueth of his meaning in the controuerſie of honour of images. As alſo doth Valentia aboute the wordes of Theodoret touching tranſſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, who ſayth that the ſubſtance of bread &amp; wine ceaſed not in the Sacrament. To which both Valentia &amp; other diuines, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſtanding they kewe by that which paſſed in the Councell of Epheſus, Theodoretus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie not to be great, or at the leaſt not to be ſo great as that hee alone could or ought to preponderate the reſt of the Fathers, <note place="margin">Vid. Greg. de Val. l. 2. de tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſub. c. 7. &amp; Suarez de. Eucha. D. 46. ſec. 4.</note> I haue giuen other ſolide anſweres to his wordes beſides this which is related by the knight, as that he calleth the accidents of the Euchariſt by the name of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread &amp; wine attributing to the naturall properties of nature or ſubſtance, the name of nature or ſubſtance it ſelfe, as both the ſcriptures &amp; other Fathers in the like occaſions vſe to doe, <note place="margin">Gelaſ. ep.</note> &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie <hi>Gelaſius</hi> whome the reformers vſe to cite againſt the trueth of tranſſubſtantiation, he onelie taking the worde ſubſtance (which is ambiguous &amp; ſignifieth both the interior ſubſtance itſelfe, &amp; the externall ſignes of the ſame) for the ſecond, not for the firſt: all which may be eaſilie perceiued by him who
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:2119:211"/> shall read the authours them ſelues with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; care. And as for Theodoretus, Iames Gordon in his fourth Controuerſie of tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation noteth that if he be trulie tranſlated according to the force of the Greeke wordes, all difficultie touching his true meaning doth preſentlie ceaſe. And thus much for Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retus who is no way eluded by Valentia, but truelie &amp; ſincerelie expounded.</p>
                     <p>As for Bellarmin whome when he anſwereth to the teſtimonie of S. Cyprian aboute tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the knight ſeemeth to taxe for attributing error vnto him. It is not true that Bellar. ſayth that he doth not maruell that S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erred in reaſoning, as Sir Humfrey affirmeth, but the Cardinall onlie ſayth of S. Cyprian, <hi>ideo non mirum ſi more errantium ratiocinaretur: therefore it was no maruell if he should argue after the manner of thoſe that erre,</hi> becauſe he writ that paſſage to which Bellarmin doth anſere in the place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the knight, when he defended his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour aboute rebaptization againſt S. Auguſtin. But withall Bellarmin addeth that S. Cyprian reiected not all traditions as the reformers commonlie doe, at the leaſt in faith &amp; manners: but onelie he diſalowed that tradition in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular which S. Auguſtin alledged againſt his error, &amp; onelie for that reaſon becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it to be cotrarie to ſcriptures, which yet afterwardes appeared not to be ſo by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:2119:212"/> of the Church not to be. So that Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin is both here falſelie accuſed to haue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelie affirmed S. Cyprian to haue erred in reaſoning, &amp; alſo it is falſe that his teſtimonie touching traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in generall is by him eluded, which is that Sir Humfrey ought to proue if he ſpeakes according to his owne purpoſe in this place.</p>
                     <p>And not much vnlike to this is the ſame Bellarmin falſelie accuſed by the knight to haue affirmed that S. Chriſoſtome exceeded the trueth when he ſayd. It is better not to be preſent at the ſacrifice then to be preſent, &amp; not comunicate, for Bellarmin ſayd not that ſainct Chryſoſtome exceeded the truth, but onelie that he ſpoake by exceſſe, <hi>per exceſſum ita eſſe locutum,</hi> or <hi>amplificandi gratia,</hi> as he ſayth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, which is not to exceede the truth but to vſe a tropicall ſpeech by which the trueth is as farre extended as may be poſſible within her boundes but no further. And more ouer Bellarmin addeth ſo much beſides to this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſere to Saint Chryſoſtomes wordes, <note place="margin">Vide Bell. l. 2. de Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa. cap. 10. § Porro Chryſoſt.</note> as takes all difficultie quite away touching his meaning in the point of Priuate Maſſe.</p>
                     <p>Neyther is Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>freys complainte againſt Bellarmin leſſe vniuſte, where he ſayth, yet not ſpecifiing aboute what matter, that the Cardinall affirmes Prudentius to playe the poet, for why should anie man be reprehended
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:2119:212"/> for attributing to a Poet that which is proper to all thoſe of his profeſſion that is to ſpeake by way of fiction or to vſe poeticall licence. The trueth is I can finde no ſuch wordes of Bellarmin as Sir Humfrey citeth, but ſuppoſe he ſpeaketh in that manner of Prudentius, yet I hould it to be no greater an extenuation of his authoritie then it were an extenuation of Sir Humfreys honour to ſay he vſeth his weapons dexterouſlie or plaieth the Champion coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſlie. But yet worſe then this doth Sir Humfrey deale with Bellarmin aboute his anſere to a certaine teſtimonie of Tertullian. For whereas he onelie ſayth that Tertullians authoritie is of no great accounte when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts other Fathers, &amp; when, as S. Hierome ſpeaketh, <hi>he was no man of the Church:</hi> the knight to ſaue labor, but not to ſaue his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, leaueth out that ſpeeche of S. Hierome &amp; putteth the whole cenſure of Tertullian vpon Bellarmin onelie, notobſtanding it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares plainelie that the greater parte of it is taken out of S. Hierome, &amp; ſo conſequentlie if anie proofe or recorde were eluded in Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Sir Humfrey might more iuſtelie haue accuſed him, then the Cardinall. But it ſeemes the knight proceeded in this as thoſe that in caſes of reuenge either for want of wit, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſtill ſtrike their next fellowe whether he be in faulte or no.</p>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:2119:213"/>
                     <p>In concluſion Sir Humfrey had no reaſon to ſtand vpon Bellarmin's anſere to thoſe two authours, I meane Prudentius &amp; Tertullian; for that neither of them in the places cited ſpeaketh of anie point of doctrine defined by the Church, but of other matters in which as it was free for them to ſpeake what they pleaſed, ſo was it alſo free for Bellarmin to anſere what he pleaſed, eſpeciallie ſuppoſing that Tertullian ſpeakes but doubfullie in the matter for which he is taxed by the Cardinall, that is in the manner of Chriſts penetration of his mothers wombe: &amp; if he held he was borne according to the courſe of nature, he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth the reſt of the Fathers, in which caſe no one Father hath the credit of an abſolute teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie amongeſt the Romaniſts, neyther can he or anie for him iuſtelie complaine if he be diſeſteemed in ſuch a caſe.</p>
                     <p>Now for the cenſure which Riuera giueth of Origen to wit that he was full of errours which the Church hath alwayes deteſted, it is ſo manifeſtlie true that no man that will not dogmatize with him can denie the ſame. And the truth is that the reformers make as little, yea &amp; much leſſe account either of him or anie other ancient writers, then the Romaniſts doe, as the world knoweth, eſpecially when they finde them contrarie to their poſitions. And not of one, two, or three diſſenting from the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:2119:213"/> reſt, but euen of the torrent of their conſent of which ouer plaine teſtimonie is extant in Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Caluin Kemnitius, &amp; Chamier. <note place="margin">Vid. Luth. de capt. Babyl. c. 1. Calu. 4. Inſtit. c. 18 Kem. pag. 798. Cham. de deſcenſ. Chr. ad Inf.</note> And yet for all this the knight could produce nothing in particular in which he could accuſe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts to haue reiected the recordes of the foreſaid authours at the leaſt in matter of faith.</p>
                     <p>As for S. Hierome whome Canus affirmeth to be no rule of faith. I would knowe what reformer will maintaine the contrarie? And if they hould him to be a rule of faith then a dieu their all-ſufficiencie of ſcripture. Beſides Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus yealdes a pregnant reaſon why S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome was not to be followed in that particular of which he ſpeakes in that place, to wit in the aſſignation of the Canon of the old teſtament, becauſe ſayth Canus he followed Ioſeph the Iewe, but S. Auſtin followed the Chriſtians in that point of doctrine: which reaſon of Canus Sir Humfrey ought not to haue omitted if he had dealt ſincerelie.</p>
                     <p>As impertinent as this alſo is the taxation of Bellarmins anſwere to Iuſtin, Ireneus, Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius &amp; Oecumenius who ſeeme to haue held that the diuells are not to be torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with the paines of hell before the day of Iudgement. For this is ſo abſurde a poſition that I thinke fewe or none of the miſreformed Churches defend it, &amp; ſo I ſee not why Bellarmin can iuſtelie be reprehended for ſaying that he ſeeth not how
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:2119:214"/> the foreſaid authours can be excuſed from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in that particular, for that the Cardinall onelie condemneth them in that which the reformers themſelues according to reaſon &amp; ſounde doctrine ought to condemne alſo, &amp; that in no queſtion of Controuerſie betweene vs &amp; them, nor which can iuſtelie preiudice the foreſayd Fathers authoritie in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, eſpecially in which they all agree.</p>
                     <p>Laſtelie ſayth Sir Humfrey, we produce the vniforme conſent of Fathers againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception of the Bleſſed Virgin. To which Salmeron the Ieſuit, quoth hee, anſereth that, weake is the place which is drawne from authoritie. But firſt I aſke of Sir Humfrey what he &amp; his conſorts haue to doe with the immaculate Conception? For that is no Controuerſie of faith betwixt the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts &amp; them, it is a queſtion among ſome Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts them ſelues, &amp; lawfull for either ſide to make the beſt vſe they can of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Fathers either by imbraſing them, or expounding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that particular point, as they finde them moſt aduantageous for the defence of their ſeuerall opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſo farre as the Church permits the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that without any diſparishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to their authority in regarde their wordes are not ſo plaine, but that they may ſeeme to admit diuers expoſitions in that particular. And as for Salmero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he neither ſpeaketh of the Fathers in
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:2119:214"/> generall when all or moſt of them conſent in a matter of fayth, nor yet when they plainelie agree in anie other point of doctrine, but onely when they ſpeake doubtfullie or obſcurelie, &amp; this I ſay vpon ſuppoſition the place of the foreſaid authour is truelie cited, which, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde I haue taken the knight ſo often tardie in that Kynde of proceeding, I may vnrashlie ſuſpected. And the truth is that hauing now viewed the place in the booke which is in the 51. Diſputation of Salmeron vpon the 5. to the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. I finde that he ſpeakes not of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme conſent of Fathers or Doctors, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of a certaine great number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to which he oppoſeth an other as great, as he ſuppoſeth, yea &amp; greater: &amp; therefore he addes. <hi>Quare ſi authorum numero decertare velint</hi> (meaning the oppoſers of the immaculate conception of the Virgen) <hi>procul dubio abſorbebuntur.</hi> So that this author is abuſed iuſt as I did coniecture before I ſa his booke. And altho' I can not much commend Salmeron for anie great inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſneſſe in his application of the shepards ſentence, yet ſure I ame that if he applied it not verie aptelie, you Sir Humfrey applie it much worſe &amp; more abſurdelie. And thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nowe examined all the particulars of this ſection &amp; hauing founde nothing which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the authours intent, I will end my period yet noting by the way how vanelie Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:2119:215"/> concludeth his diſcourſe affirming his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to haue heard the proofe of the Romish witneſſes in the behalfe of the Proteſtant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine made good by the teſtimonies of the Fathers themſelues; which notobſtanding is all falſe &amp; meere deluſion, for that I haue made it clearelie appeare that neyther anie Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt by him cited hath graunted that anie one of the Fathers doth teach anie point of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant doctrine, nor yet that they ſpeake in thoſe places here cited of the cheefe points of doctrine in Controuerſie: but contrarilie it appeareth that they ſpeake onelie either of other matters which little concerne the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, or at the leaſt they ſpeake in an other ſenſe then the reformers pretend: yea &amp; that which is more remarkable, not with vniforme conſent, but rather fewe or at the moſt two or three in one matter, in which manner of proceeding, what argument ſoeuer may be deduced from them, it is no more trulie to be iudged &amp; called the teſtimonie of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abſolutelie, then that may be called abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the teſtimony of the reformers in which neuertheleſſe onelie ſome fewe of them yeald their teſtimonies, &amp; yet that but in ſome particulars, &amp; thoſe no principall points of faith.</p>
                     <p>And as for this complaint which Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey maketh ſo formallie of the eluſion of the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:2119:215"/> proofes, &amp; recordes of the Fathers, as alſo tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that which he in like manner frameth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Roman Church for her prohibition, or cenſure of bookes, I wonder with what face he can reprehend that which he knoweth to be ſo much practized in his owne Church, in which there cannot the leaſt pamphlet, or ſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt volume come forth which if it doth but ſeeme to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradict anie parte or point of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish faith, or anie other point of Puritanimſe, is not preſentlie ceaſed vpon by a pack of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiuants, &amp; put to the tortor of the Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall aſſemblie there to receiue ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, by virtue of which it ſeldome ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the flames of Vulcan. Of which in parte is witneſſe Doctour Mountagues latelie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished booke, which by reaſon it ſauored a little of ſome points of Romaniſme; by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Apeale euen to Ceſar himſelfe, could not be ſaued from the ſeuere cenſure of the Puritan ſinagoge. And particularlie touching the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of ancient Fathers, if it were a faulte in the Romaniſts to call in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome paſſages, or ſentences of ſome of their writings where they iuſtelie ſuſpect them to haue ben corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by heretikes: Surelie the ſectaries of theſe tymes are much deeper plunged in this nature the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are, in regarde that vnder the breight colour of reformation they doe not onelie vſe to reprehend particular paſſages, but reiect
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:2119:216"/> whole bookes, &amp; that not onelie of the moſt ancient Fathers as appeareth in the Hierarchie of ſainct Denis, but alſo whole bookes of the ſcriptures themſelues, as is manifeſt in the bookes of the Machabies &amp; others which they vtterlie renounce &amp; condemne for Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chripha, not ſparing the booke of wiſdome it ſelfe, ſuch cruell patrons they are of ignorance, and, of want of diuine knowledge. Nay &amp; now of late they are be come ſo preciſe in this their ſpirituall tyranie that in their laſt editions as I ame informed, they haue quite banished the foreſaid bookes of Machabies Tobie, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith, wiſdome Eccleſiaſticus out of their bible. To omit other bookes of leſſe moment which they haue eyther mangled or left quite out of their editions, as in the Inquiſitors Index may be ſeene. So that nowe the reader may plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie perceiue that Sir Humfrey &amp; his pure ſimmiſts, are ſo farre from excuſe for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune complaint of the Romaniſts in this particular, that we may iuſtelie compare them to thoſe Phariſeis who could ſooner ſee a mote in their fellowes eye then a beame in their owne. And ſo here I leaue them all to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured for hypocrites by Chriſt himſelfe, &amp; paſſe to the next ſection.</p>

                     <head>THE XII. PERIOD.</head>
                     <p>THIS Period shall containe an other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of the knight, in which he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Romaniſts with the crime of razing the recordes of the reformers, &amp; clipping their owne authours tongues, by which, ſayth he, they are conuinced of an ill cauſe, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. But how falſelie the Romaniſts be accuſed by Sir Humfrey it plainelie appeares by the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of witneſſes which I will make preſentlie: and in the meane time let but the reader reflect vpon that which hath hitherto ben ſayd, &amp; he will eaſilie perceiue that Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey himſelfe is conuinced not onelie of a bad cauſe, &amp; an ill conſcience, but alſo of ſuch groſſe proceedings as is not able either to the partes or ſu credit of a Caualier. But now to particulars.</p>
                     <p>His firſt charge is layde vpon the inquiſitors for blotting out a certaine note made in the margen of the Bible of Robertus Stephanus vpon the 4. chapter of the deuter. That God prohibiteth grauen images to be made. But what razing of recordes is this? Is a newe note made by ſome one, moderne, vnknowne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour not ſutable to the true ſenſe of the text, &amp; in ſuch an edition of the bible as cannot be of anie long ſtanding, to be accounted one of your recordes? And if it be yours how came it
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:2119:217"/> into the Bible what doth it there? hath not the Inquitor as much authoritie to put it out as ſome obſcure brother of yours had to put it in? the true meaning of the ſcripture neither in the place of that note, nor anie other is, that God did prohibit abſolutelie all grauen images (as one of the greateſt diuines you haue, doth ingenuouſlie confeſſe) <note place="margin">Daniel Chamie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, l 21. de imag. c. 8. n. 1.</note> but onelie he did forbid them to be made to the end to adore them as Gods, or at the leaſt to adore them with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of idolatrie, and yet the foreſayd wiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation maketh the ſcripture to forbid all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen images abſolutelie. Wherefore its nothing but a falſe recorde ordayned to deceiue the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by abuſing the true ſenſe of Gods worde, &amp; ſo the Inquiſitor when he branded it with a <hi>deleatur,</hi> he did but execute iuſtice vpon a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifier of the Kings letters, which in him neither argueth bad cauſe nor ill conſcience, but sheweth both of them to be in the authour of the counterfet recorde which he foyſted in to the ſacred bible. To omit that it being no note of anie Roman authour as it manifeſtlie sheweth it ſelfe not to be: yet the knight leap'd quite out of the quire when he cited it for a record of his owne, except he ſuppoſeth al the writings of the pretended reformed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of what ſect ſoeuer they be, to be recordes for his Church againſt the Roman doctrine: which is both moſt ridiculous in itſelfe, nor yet
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:2119:217"/> was anie ſuch razing of the reformers recordes euer intended eyther by the Inquiſitors, or by anie other cenſurer of bookes in the Church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond charge is aboute a certaine gloſſe vpon Gratian, which gloſſe affirmeth (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Sir Humfreyes relation) that the Preiſt cannot ſay ſignificatiuelie of the bread, <hi>this is my bodie,</hi> without telling a lye. This gloſſe (ſaith hee) is condemned by the inquiſitor to be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out. It is true the Inquiſitor did ſo, but what then? did he therefore doe it wit an ill conſcience, I denie the conſequence. And in your conſcience Sir Humfrey is it not an idle gloſſe indeed? Doe not your miniſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues when they deliuer the communion call it the bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt? And if the Preiſt lyeth when he ſayth ſo not of the bread (as the falſe gloſſe ſayth if ſo, it ſaith) but of that which is contained vnder the forme of bread, ſurelie your miniſters tell a farre greater lye when they ſay ſignificatiuelie of the bare bread, that it is the bodie of Chriſt, truelie &amp; reallie, as Maſter Caluin affirmeth. <note place="margin">Inſtit. l. 4. cap. 17.</note> And ſo I conclude this point, that Sir Humfrey had no reaſon at all to accuſe the Inquiſitor of an ill conſcience in razing onelie ſuch a recorde as is no leſſe repugnant to the doctrine of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, then to the Roman faith if anie matter of faith it were, which indeed it is not;

                     <p>Thirdlie Sir Humfrey chargeth the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor for blotting out Caſſanders whole tract of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion in both kynds. But what worſe conſcience sheweth the Inquiſitor in this fact then the Inquiſitors of the reformed Churches doe, who are not content with a ſimple <hi>dolea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> but daylie condemne whole Catholike volumes to the vnmercifull Vulcan.

                     <p>Fourthlie Caietans opinion that the wordes, <hi>this is my bodie,</hi> doe not ſufficientlie proue tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, is no recorde for you, as you falſelie ſuppoſe, for he doth not denie tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation as you doe, but expreſſelie defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, as his owne wordes declare which I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes recitie: nay he doth not affirme ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelle (as ſuarez wordes quoted by your ſelfe in your owne margent expreſſely declare) that the foreſaid wordes doe not ſufficientlie proue tranſſubſtantiation as you corruptedlie relate, but onelie ſayth at the moſt that, ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Churches authoritie, they doe not proue it: which, not as contrarie to faith, but as a ſingular, &amp; extrauagant opinion of that
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:2119:218"/> authour, Pope Pius did (if perhaps he did) piouſlie blot it out, not preciſelie becauſe it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoreth the reformers (as in trueth it doth not to anie purpoſe) but becauſe it ſm'at disfauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the truth, which is that tranſſubſtantiation is indeed plainelie enough contayned in thoſe wordes of Chriſt, <hi>this is my bodie.</hi> Howbeit I muſt needs aduertice the reader that I ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finde thoſe wordes ſuppoſed to be Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, blotted in anie Index that I haue ſeene, nor yet can I finde them in anie edition of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ietan in the place cited by Suarez, that is vpon the 75. q. art. 1. But onelie theſe. <hi>Conuerſio non habetur explicite in Euangelio,</hi> &amp; theſe. <hi>Quod Euangelium non explicauit expreſſe, ab Eccleſia accepimus.</hi> Nay more then this I finde other wordes in the ſame place which conuince that Caietan held tranſſubſtantiation to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie contained in thoſe wordes <hi>this is my bodie,</hi> for ſo he argues. <hi>Sacramenta nouae legis efficiunt quod ſignificant, ac per hoc verba Chriſti hoc est corpus meum quia efficiunt vtramque noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem ſcilicet conuerſionis &amp; continentiae (vt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſse dicta ſacri Concilij authoritas teſtatur) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequens eſt vt cadem Chriſti verba ſignificent vtramque nouitatem.</hi> Wherefore ſuppoſing Caietan ſaid not that the wordes: <hi>this is my bodie:</hi> conteine not ſufficientlie tranſſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, but onelie not expreſſelie: I cannot conceiue what foundation Suarez might haue

Neither is it any way probable that ſuch a holie Bishop as Walricus was, should commend marriage in other Preiſts, who liued and dyed in vnmarried chaſtity himſelfe, and ſo the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd Epiſtle being a falſe record, as containing an improbable yea a morally impoſſible rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was iuſtely condemned with a <hi>deleatur.</hi> To omit that if this Epiſtle wer authenticall, the reformers would gaine nothing by the bargen for that it teacheth expreſſely that the Roman Bishop is head of the Church, and that Preiſts at the leaſt after ordination cannot lawfully marrie.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly it is falſe that Bertram's whole booke is condemned, as may appeare by
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:2119:219"/> the iudgement of the Vniuerſitie of Doway ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the Cenſurers of bookes inſerted in the Index of Quiroya published by <hi>Ioannes Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> a reformed deformed diuine with certaine odious prefaces of his owne coyning, &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Argentin 1609. In the 17. page of which Index it is manifeſt that the whole booke was not commaunded to be blotted out, but onely ſome fewe things to be corrected, or altered in the reading, or to be expounded benigneouſly. And as for the doctrine of tranſſubſtantiation, the foreſaid Doctours of Doway expreſſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that Bertram often times in the firſt parte of his diſputation teaches Catholike tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation plainely enuffe, vſing the words <hi>conuertere, mutare, commutare, permutare tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere creaturam in Chriſtum, in corpus Christi &amp;c.</hi> in ſo much that Illiricus compelled with the plaineſſe of thoſe wordes, confeſſeth there are in Bertram <hi>ſemina tranſſubſtantiationis, ſeeds of tranſubſtantiation.</hi> And alſo the ſame Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Doctors conclude that thoſe difficult places which are founde in him touching the reall preſence, which cheefely are two, to wit that he ſeemeth to haue ben of opinion that Chriſts bodie is no more in the Euchariſt then the bodie of the people, and that that thing which is celebrated or done in the Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called God; are either to be vnderſtood of the externall formes of bread and wine: or
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:2119:220"/> els that thoſe ſentences be inſerted by heretiks who printed that booke firſt at Colen. 1532. &amp; after at Baſil. 1550. &amp; 1555. ſo that this is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde of the reformers, except it be vpon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their owne corruptions or falſe gloſſes added vnto it; but rather may ſerue for a pregnant teſtimonie againſt them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly he that should haue blotted it out, had done them no iniurie but a verie great fauor.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthlie I ſay to the ſentence taken out of the booke of baptizme vnder the name of Anſelme, that manie paſſages be blotted out by the Cenſurers of bookes, by reaſon they are ſuch as may eaſilie be taken in an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous ſenſe, &amp; ſo ſcandalize or giue occaſion of errour either to the ſimple, or malicious reader, which neuertheleſſe in a ſounde ſenſe containe no falſe doctrine, &amp; ſo might be lefte vncorrected if it were not for the corruption &amp; malignitie of the tyme.

                     <p>8. We haue ſayd ſufficient alreadie touching the credit of Caſſander, whoſe doctrine the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts hould for falſe recordes either in parte or totalitie. And he maketh ſuch prepoſterous gloſſes vpon the Eccleſiaſticall himnes, as the Index noteth in one place, that all his whole <hi>ſcholium</hi> is repugnant to the ſame like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie contrarie to the text. Yet to giue the reader a taſte What truelie this man was, who is ſo farre in Sir Humfreys bookes: I ſay that altho' we hold not Caſſander for a Romaniſt, as being in the Index of prohibited bookes for diuers ſingular poſitions, neuertheleſſe the knight cannot iuſtelie brag of him in regarde it is manifeſt by his workes which I haue ſeene &amp; read in parte, that he expreſſelie defendes the Roman doctrine in moſt points of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie betwixt vs &amp; the Reformers: as alſo becauſe in a greater parte euen of the ſame places which Sir Hum. cites in his fauour, he is not a little abuſed &amp; either corrupted or detorted by him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to his meaning. Howbeit in reſpect he profeſſeth the parte of a Pacifer &amp; mediator betwixt vs, he could not but leane ſome thing to their ſide, yet is it ſo little that I perceiue by one of his writings that he had ſmale thankes for his paines from ſome of the faction, &amp; therefore was moſt sharpelie handled by them accuſing him of diſſimulation, impoſture, interruption
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:2119:221"/> of the courſe of the Goſpell &amp; the like. An infortunate man who by his great labours &amp; earneſt endeuours to content both parties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended neither: a iuſte punishment due vnto ſuch as deſtitute of true knowledge in diuinitie (which he himſelfe in parte confeſſeth in his generall Preface) preſume to treat of thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime ſubiects ſans a guide.</p>
                     <p>The Baſilean edition of Polidor virgill prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the yeare 1544. compared with other former &amp; the moſt ancient editions is founde to haue ben corrupted by the ſectaries &amp; ſo no true recordes can be taken out of it for Sir Humfrey &amp; his confraternitie. And ſuch is that paſſage which the Inquiſitours comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be blotted out, which is this. All moſt all ancient Fathers condemned images for feare of idolatrie. This ſentence as falſe &amp; foyſted into the foreſayd Baſilian edition, is iuſtelie caſt out as none of the authours doctrine, or at the leaſt vehementlie ſuſpected for none of his. And touching the doctrine of honour of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it ſelfe, it is cleare that he can aforde no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde at all for the reformed diuinitie, for that he expreſſelie relateth the vſe of images in Churches deduceing it hiſtoricallie from the moſt primatiue tymes. Langius or Langus is of no authoritie among the Romaniſts &amp; ſo he yealdes no recordes of credit. And at the beſt he is but a pedanticall Annotator, &amp; as I take
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:2119:221"/> it a Lutheran, that is neither of Sir Humfreys religion nor of ours.</p>
                     <p>As for Ferus certaine it is that ſome of his editions haue ben founde to be mightilie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted particularlie that of Mogunce. Which the knight citeth &amp; ſo the recordes drawne out of him are of no authoritie. But ſuppoſe Cephas did indeed not ſignifie the head, yet what great recorde I praye can that be for Sir Humfreys Church? And ſo whether Cephas ſignifie the head or the feet, &amp; whether ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculum eſt be in, or out of the bookes, it auayles him nothing but ſome ſmale matter to quarell aboute: yet the truth is that the moſt authenticall edition of Anwerpe 1585. hath the ſame wordes which Sir Humfreyes cites out of the Roman print: in ſuch ſorte as one may rather much more ſuſpect thoſe wordes, <hi>it is ridiculous:</hi> to be falſelie added in the Mogun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin edition then detracted in the others.</p>
                     <p>Finallie whether the wordes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Laodicea be that wee ought not to leaue the Church of God &amp; inuocate Angells, as Sir Humfrey will haue it, &amp; alſo ſome Catholike copies haue: or whether in ſteed of the worde Angells wee reade angles or corners, as ſome other editions haue, the matter is not great ſo the decree be reight vnderſtood, that is ſo that the ſenſe bee this: we ought not to leaue the Church of God &amp; inuocate Angells ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſlie
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:2119:222"/> as ſome did in thoſe tymes. For this being the true meaning of the Councell as it appeareth by the ſubſequent wordes which are thoſe, <hi>and make congregations of abominable idolatrie to the Angells,</hi> it is more then plaine that no recorde can there be founde for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the reformed Churches. But onelie it ſerues Sir Humfrey to make a plauſible flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish to the ſimple reader, to the end that by working vpon his weakneſſe by falſelie taxing his aduerſaries, hee may make his owne impoſtures ſaleable, which otherwiſe would putrifie &amp; ſpoile for want of vtterance.</p>
                     <p>Laſtelie for proofe of his accuſation, Sir Humfrey after all this ſturre he hath made, produceth onelie one witneſſe, &amp; that a falſe one: and altho' for the greater credit of his cauſe, he held it expedient to giue him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of a diuinitie reader &amp; profeſſor, &amp; Deane of Louaine, yet hauing examined the matter, I founde by better information then Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey can haue, that Boxhorne before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolte had onelie the place a certaine of obſcure Deanrie: which function altho' it be a place of ſome credit, yet it is farre inferiour to the dignitie either of a Deane of a Capitall Church, or of a publike profeſſour of diuinitie in the vniuerſitie of Louaine, both in learning, honour, &amp; profit. And yet this man as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by authenticall relation of the Deane of
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:2119:222"/> S. Gudula Church in Bruſſels, &amp; others: after ſome extraordinary familiarity which out of his ouer amorous nature he vſed to a domeſtike maide ſeruant of his owne, &amp; out of an vnſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſſe of his lubrik mynde, began at firſt to defend that, it was not neceſſarie for the Preiſt to prononce the wordes of conſecration orally, but onelie to ſpeake them mentallie, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>(as nemo repente fit malus)</hi>

                     <p>And this is the onely man which Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey could bring for a witneſſe againſt the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Roman Church in her manner of cenſuring bookes or correcting the ſame, or approuing them according to the order &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Councell of Trent, which collapſed Deane being ſo infamous in his life as by this which I haue ſpecified, and more which I could relate, doth appeare, and being alſo now a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enimy and Apoſtata from his mother Church, let the reader iudge whether in reaſon his teſtimony ought to be admitted againſt her:

                     <p>You aske vs, Sir Humfrey, whether the worde of God is ſubiect to alteration or nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth &amp; Index expurgatorious, but to this your wiſe demaunde I anſer, that the worde of God in itſelfe is wholelie immutable, ſo pure that it can need no purifying, yet as it is &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by artificiall caracters for the vſe of man, ſo it is not onelie mutable &amp; corruptible, but alſo <hi>de facto</hi> it is &amp; hath ben corrupted, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe your owne Bibles in England. And wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that renowned King Iames your owne ſoueraine &amp; beſt defender of your faith, who was ſo ashamed of the tranſlations which he founde at his arriuall to the English Crowne, that he preſently ſought a remedy for the ſame (tho' he founde it not, as appeareth by his new tranſlation which yet is not as it ought to be)

                     <p>Neither ought the corruptions founde in the reformed Bibles to be called <hi>peccadillos</hi> or ſmale faultes as Sir Humfrey would haue them to the end they may be the more eaſilie win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at: for ſuppoſe they were neuer ſo little in themſelues, yet are they to be eſteemed great &amp; horrible abuſes in regarde of the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence which ought to be had towardes thoſe ſacred volumes of the worde of God, it being treaſon in the higheſt degree to offer to falſifie or alter them anie way whatſoeuer. And let the reader be iudge whether it be but a ſmale faulte to tranſlate <hi>images</hi> for <hi>idols,</hi> as the English bible of the yeare 1562. hath <hi>in the text:</hi> or as an other of the yeare 1577. hath in the margen vpon the firſt chapter of the Epiſtle of S.

Wherefore thoſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:2119:227"/> which the knight citeth as if they had ſpoken irreuerentlie &amp; blaſphemonlie of the holie ſcriptures doe no more iniurie vnto them then S. Paule did when 2. Cor. 3. he ſayth of them, <hi>litera occidit,</hi> the letter killeth, <note place="margin">Lib. de Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodis.</note> or then did S. Hilarie when he teacheth that manie he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies haue their origin from ſcriptures ill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, or then Martin Luther who called the Bible <hi>liber haereticorum</hi> the booke of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. None of which ſpeeches as I ſuppoſe Sir Humfrey will dare to condemne either of blaſphemie or irreuerence, nay if he haue his ſenſes aboute him he will eaſilie perceiue that thoſe &amp; other ſuch like phraſes are not meant actiuelie of the worde of God, but onelie paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelie, that is that throu' the malice of the falſe interpreter it is ſo irreuerentlie detorted &amp; abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as if indeed it were as flexible as a noſe of waxe. And according to this we ſee that none of that which our aduerſarie produceth here out of the Romaniſts is anie argument of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence againſt the trueth, &amp; inuiolabilitie of Gods worde, but a calumnious accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quite contrarie to the ſenſe &amp; meaning of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid authours, who had not anie intention to taxe the ſcriptures but the corrupters &amp; falſe interpreters of them, ſuch as you pſeudorefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers are your ſelues.</p>
                     <p>And now altho' by this which I haue ſayd in generall touching this point of blaſphemie
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:2119:227"/> againſt ſcripture ſuppoſed to be perpetrated by the Romaniſts, the authors by the knight cyted remaine ſufficientlie cleared from the imputation which he layes vpon them in that nature: neuertheleſſe becauſe by the particular examen of the places cyted I haue diſcouered that either all or moſt of their wordes, be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corruptedlie rehearſed, or their ſenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, &amp; abuſed, therefore I will ſeuerallie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate their paſſages, &amp; declare in what reſpects our aduerſarie hath deceitfullie traduced them.</p>
                     <p>And to begin with Lindanus, his ſtromata in deed I could not haue, but I haue read the place cited out of his Panoplia, where I finde that when he names the ſcripture a dead &amp; killing letter, he onelie alludes to the wordes of S.

<pb n="456" facs="tcp:2119:228"/> as I conceiue) is put in to dead &amp; killing letters. As his wordes quoted in Latin in the margen declare. And in this ſame ſenſe I may iuſtelie &amp; truelie ſuppoſe the ſame authour ſpeakes in the place quoted out of his other worke if any ſuch ſaying he hath, in regarde that a graue &amp; learned man as he is knowne to haue ben, is euer iudged to be ſutable to himſelfe in all times &amp; places.

                     <p>In the citation of Pighius Sir Humfrey ought to haue continued his rehearſal from the beginning of his wordes to the end of the period of the authors whole paſſage, &amp; then it would haue appeared plainelie howe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelie he is accuſed.

                     <p>And conformable to this alſo which wee haue ſaid becauſe the Romaniſts know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience how falſelie the miſreformers vſe to

And ſo if they cite Berengarius &amp; the walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they iuſtelie reiect them as heretikes: If they cite reformers for Romaniſts they iuſtely reiect them for none of theirs. If they cite Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike authours impertinentlie, corruptedlie, or in a falſe ſenſe, they iuſtelie reiected them as abuſed by them &amp; ſo remit them to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers purgatorie. If they cite ſcriptures either falſelie tranſlated by addition, or detraction, or falſelie interpreted, or falſified, they iuſtelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect them as imperfect, &amp; as made by them a couerture for theeues, &amp; an officine or shop of heretikes, And yet notobſtanding all this it is manifeſt both by an expreſſe decree which the Councell of Trent made in the fourth ſeſ. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the profaners of the ſacred ſcriptures, <note place="margin">Decret. de edit. &amp; vſu ſacrorum l. verſ. fin.</note> as alſo by ſome ceremonies of the Maſſe it ſelfe, that the Romaniſts giue farre greater reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence euerie way vnto them without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then the Reformers. And the ſame I ſay of the ancient Fathers who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Romaniſts as it is well knowne, reſpect ſo much that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counte it plaine temeritie in anie writer to teach anie doctrine contrarie to the common conſent of them: Whereas one the contrarie,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:2119:231"/> there is nothing more ordinarie among the writers of the miſreformed Churches the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the authoritie of the ancient Fathers, or at the leaſt to vilifie them &amp; ſpeake contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie of them as diuers of their workes doe teſtifie.</p>
                     <p>But for all this Sir Humfrey is ſtill har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vpon that ſtring that the Roman Church houlds the ſcriptures to be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: but I knowe none that makes them ſo imperfect as the miſreformed Churches by cutting of diuers partes of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning them for Apochripha in their conſiſtoriall ſeſſions, &amp; by corrupting the text by falſe tranſlations &amp; erroneous interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as I haue aboue declared. And touching the Roman Church I haue alreadie tould him that he belyeth her. For neither she here ſelfe nor anie of her members euer defended that <hi>tenet</hi> abſolutelie that the ſcriptures are imperfect. But onelie ſome Romaniſts affirme the ſcriptures alone to be no perfect rule of faith, yet they neuer ſay they are imperfect. For one thing it is to be perfect in them ſelues, &amp; an other thing to be perfect as they be a rule of faith. The firſt is abſolutelie true &amp; maintained by all Romaniſts; the ſecond is but true <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> &amp; with reſtriction, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath ben declared, or as it is but one parte yet the cheefeſt &amp; the farre more perfect &amp;
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:2119:231"/> noble. Wherefore the Romaniſts as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may perceiue hould both the ſcriptures &amp; Fathers for perfect &amp; campleit abſolutelie ſpeaking, wher as the reformers whatſoeuer they ſay in wordes, yet indeeds they doe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle &amp; martyrize them moſt cruellie, as a booke published by a reformed miniſter, called the cenſure of the Fathers doth giue ouer plaine teſtimonie. <note place="margin">

                     <p>And to ſay the Romaniſts ſilence ſcriptures, it is ſo manifeſt an vntruth as it needs no other confutation. But by the lye.

                     <p>SIR Humfrey tells vs that in this ſection following there are contained allegations collected out of Bellarmin for teſtification of the truth of the reformed doctrine in the cheefe points of controuerſie.</p>
                     <p>I haue alreadie declared that the Romaniſts reiect not either true ſcriptures, or Fathers; nor yet anie other authours of the Roman Church, but onelie as either corrupted by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:2119:232"/> or els onelie where we finde them to haue ſome ſingular opinion, or tenet againſt the vniforme doctrine of the reſt in matters of faith manners, or Eccleſiaſticall practice or diſcipline: or els in ſome particular points not then ſufficientlie declared &amp; determined by the Church when they did ſo vtter their opinions; of which ſorte of writers neuertheleſſe there neuer were anie ſuch either in number or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of doctrine as could either make or marre the antiquitie &amp; vniuerſalitie of the Church in that nature.</p>
                     <p>And as for Bellarmin whome Sir Humfrey citeth in this ſection, we are ſo farre from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king exceptions at anie thing that he euer writ &amp; published, that we all hould him for a moſt faithfull &amp; diligent defender not onelie of the principall points of our faith but alſo of euerie one of them in particular, &amp; of the whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doctrine in ſo much that I accounte it no leſſe then plaine madneſſe in that man whoe shall offer to make vſe of his teſtimonie for the contrarie, knowing for certaine that if he be ſincerelie alledged &amp; rightlie vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be founde in him for the aduerſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. And to the end that this may more plainely appeare I will breeflie examen thoſe particular places which Sir Humfrey produceth, for the contrarie.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore he citeth Bellarmin as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:2119:233"/> the vncertainty of all the Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (as the knight termeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) becauſe forſooth in his third booke of Iuſtification the 8. chap. he graunteth that none can be certaine by the certaintie of faith that he receiueth a true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, in regard in depends vpon the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miniſter. But this teſtimonie I haue alreadie shewed to be deluſorie, &amp; it is wholie impertinent to the purpoſe, for that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion aboute the neceſſitie of the knowledge of the intention of the miniſter by faith, is no principall controuerſie betwixt vs but rather meerelie incident. Neyther yet can the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers finde the contrarie poſition in anie place of ſcripture by that meanes to make it a point of faith for themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie he induceth Bellarmin lib. 3. de Euchariſt cap. 23. touching the reformers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of tranſſubſtantiation. To which place I haue alſo anſered before; &amp; it is not for this purpoſe, in regarde there is no mention of anie denyall of the trueth of traſſubſtantiation, or confeſſion of the Reformers tenet in that point: but onelie of an other incident queſtion, viz. whether tranſſubſtantiation can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by expreſſe wordes of ſcripture. And at leaſt touching the maine point (to omit the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as impertinent &amp; diſagreable to the title of our aduerſaries queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is of principal points of controuerſie,) it is too cleare that
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:2119:233"/> Bellarmin defended the affirmatiue <hi>in terminis,</hi> in plaine tearmes. And ſo this is no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as Sir Humfrey ſeekes for in this place. Beſides that all Bellarmins confeſſion is but one pore <hi>non eſt improbabile:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdlie he citeth Bellarmins confeſſion againſt priuate Maſſe lib. 2. <hi>de Miſſa</hi> cap. 9. &amp; 10. But the latter place I haue examined before &amp; founde it corrupted by Sir Humfrey both in wordes &amp; ſenſe neyther are the wordes ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie recited by omiſſion of <hi>omnino,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratione Eccleſiae,</hi> &amp; tranſpoſition of the text. And here I further adde that neyther of the places is to this purpoſe, becauſe they proue no vnlawfulneſſe, or abſolute imperfection in priuate Maſſes, but onelie at the moſt their leſſe lawfulnes, their leſſe perfection, or their want of frequentation in the primatiue ages: which is no principall point of controuerſie betweene the Reformers, &amp; Romaniſts, nay none at all.</p>
                     <p>And touching Bellarmins confeſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the firſt place, viz. That we read not expreſſely, but gather by coniectures that the ancients did ſacrifice without communion of ſome perſon, or perſons, I ſay it is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in regarde it inuolues no diſproofe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Maſſes, as our aduerſarie counningly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuores to perſuade his vnaduiſed reader. It being ſufficient for the inſtification of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:2119:234"/> of them, that beſides the authoritie of the preſent Church which approues them, not anie worde either of ſcripture, or ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can be produced in which they ar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for vnlawful, or repugnant to Chriſts inſtitution, or commaunde. And if more then this were required for matters of practiſe in this nature: certaine it is the pretenſiue refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Church, would neuer be able to iuſtifie their owne order, and preſcription of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating at Eaſter, or ſome twiſe or thriſe more in the yeare: or their newe prohibition of not receiuing their communion euen at the point of death without a competent number: of neyther of which they haue not as much as one pore inſtance, or example in the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church. By which it appeares that Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins confeſſion is in this paſſage prepoſterouſly alledged by the knight both in reſpect of the Roman Doctrine againſt which it concludeth nothing, as alſoe in reſpect of the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce which by ſequele and illation it induceth to his owne: whoe yet offers the Cardinal ſome further abuſe by omiſſion of the worde <hi>facile,</hi> in the recytal of his text. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tamen id poſſumus ex co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris facile colligere.</hi> Bellar. ſupra.</note> 
                     </p>
                     <p>Where the reader may yet once more reflect, that altho' Bellarmin in his modeſtie tearmed the examples of antiquitie which he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth for the practiſe of priuate Maſſes at the leaſt in ſome particular caſes, no more then
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:2119:234"/> coniectures: yet if ſome of them be duely pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered &amp; vrged with their circumſtances, they may iuſtely paſſe for ſolid reaſons: as that S. Chryſoſtome diuers tymes reprehending the people moſt sharpely &amp; vehemently for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Maſſes priuate by their not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating in them: yet doth he not once either condemne ſuch Maſſes in them ſelues, or he him ſelfe euer ceaſed to celebrate them dayly euen then when he moſt preached againſt the negligence of thoſe whoe were preſent in them without receiuing the ſacrament with the preiſt. Which doubtleſſe is a morally conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding argument that Maſſes without commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the people were vſed and eſteemed lawful euen in thoſe more primatiue &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ages. To which may not vnaptely be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for confirmation of the ſame diſcourſe by way of aduertiſment, that S. Chryſoſtome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer affirmed in theſe occaſions of complainte of the people, that Maſſes in which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants ar wanting, be euill or contrarie to Chriſts ordinance or precept, but the moſt he ſaid was, that the oblation is fruſtrate when ther be none to participate: which wordes of his ar ſoe farre from reprouing the practiſe, &amp; vſe of Maſſes without comunion of the people, that they neceſſarily implye that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was in realitie cebebrated, notobſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the people did fruſtrate the intention of
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:2119:235"/> the preiſt in that by their want of deuotion they receiued not the Communion which he had prepared for them: ſuppoſing it is abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely inpoſſible to conceiue that the Maſſe or oblation could be fruſtrated for wante of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, except it were in it ſelfe a Maſſe or obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion truely &amp; really performed by the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</p>
                     <p>Fourthlie it is true that Bellarmin confeſſeth that in the primatiue Church, becauſe the Chriſtians were but fewe, they did all ſing &amp; anſere in the diuine offices. But he affirmeth not that either it then was, or now is vnlawfull to haue the publike, or priuate prayer in an vnknowne tongue, which is the onelie point in controuerſie, the reformers defending touth &amp; naile the affirmatiue, &amp; the Romaniſts the negatiue. Nay Bellarmin is ſoe farre from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the reformers doctrine in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that he expreſſelie affirmeth in the ſame place that the diuine offices in thoſe primatiue times were celebrated in Greeke which all the people did not vnderſtand, &amp; yet cleareth this whole queſtion ſo farre that if Sir Humfrey had vſed anie ſparke of ſinceritie in citing Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmins wordes home &amp; truelie, they would haue taken away all doubt concerning his meaning: Whereas by leauing out deceitfullie the latter parte of his clauſe, he cauſed in his reader a preuidicate opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the true ſenſe, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:2119:235"/> which, and the faithleſſe proceeding of our aduerſarie about the ſame, the Cardinals owne wordes intirely recited will tell the truth: for thus he ſpeakes. At <hi>obijcies ſicut Apoſtolus &amp;c.</hi> But (ſaith Bellarmin) you will obiect. As the Apoſtle would that the people might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioine, Amen: ſo alſo he was to ordaine that the diuine offices should be celebrated in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue that the people might anſwer, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <note place="margin">Bellar. l. 2. de verbo Dei. c. 16.</note> I anſer by denying the conſequence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diuine offices were performed in the Greeke tongue which manie of the people did vnderſtand, tho' not all, &amp; this was ſufficient; for the Apoſtles will was not that all should anſer. Beſides this, becauſe then the Chriſtians were fewe, they all ſung together in the Church, &amp; anſered in the diuine offices: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes the multitude increaſing, the offices were more diuided, &amp; it was left to the ſole cleargie to acomplish the common prayers, &amp; Laudes in the Church. Thus plainely doth the Cardinall declare himſelfe for a ptofeſſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie of Sir Humfrey &amp; his comperes in this particular euen ſo farre as to ſolue their greateſt obiection which they vſe to frame againſt the practiſe of the Roman Church.</p>
                     <p>Firſtlie touching the allegation of Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins confeſſion of the reformers tenet aboute the Communion in both kyndes, it is <hi>moſt falſe</hi> that Bellarmin confeſſeth it in the point in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie,

                     <p>Sixtlie touching the confeſſion of Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min aboute the duall number of proper Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we haue alreadie shewed him to be quite oppoſite to the reformers doctrine, &amp; alſo haue examined the ſame place which Sir Humfrey citeth here and founde the ſenſe of the Cardinall to haue ben egregiouſlie by him tranſuerted &amp; corrupted, &amp; ſo here is no confeſſion of anie principall point of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie made by him in fauour of his aduerſaries, but a new repetition of an old impoſture of the knights owne making.</p>
                     <pb n="473" facs="tcp:2119:236"/>
                     <p>Laſtelie the knight citeth two places, of Bellarmin. The firſt out of his 3. booke of Iuſtification the 6. chapter, is touching the reformers faith &amp; good workes which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth Bellarmin to confeſſe. But what a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous allegation is this? For it is true Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin confeſſeth in the place cited that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers hould faith &amp; repentance are requiſite to iuſtification &amp; that without them no man can be iuſtified, but this is no principall point of controuerſie: nay no queſtion at all betwene the Romaniſts &amp; the reformers, but onelie a point of doctrine which the reformers doe commonlie teach &amp; the Romaniſts doe not denie. So that this is impertinentlie alledged out of Bellarmin for faith &amp; good workes ſince that in the wordes cited out of him there is not one ſillable of good workes, but onelie of faith &amp; repentance as the reader ſees. But yet that which is moſt abſurde of all is that Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey haueing here cited Bellarmins confeſſion that the reformers hould both faith &amp; repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be required to iuſtification, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie after he citeth the ſame Bellarmin as concluding with the reformed Churches iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith onely, ſo that within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of one page the knight out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funditie of his great head peace reſolueth in fauour of his owne cauſe out of Bellarmin both that without a liuely faith &amp; an erneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:2119:237"/> no man is iuſtified, &amp; alſo that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of the reformed Churches mans iuſtification is by faith onelie. Let the reader if, he be able couple theſe two together, but if he can not let him hould for certaine that Sir Humfrey line was farre out of quare when he vttered ſuch diſparates. Now the ſecond place of the two laſte is touching iuſtification by faith onelie. But this hath ben examined before, &amp; founde to containe no confeſſion of iuſtification by faith onelie (as the knight will haue it, vnaduiſedly contradicting himſelfe out of an inordinate deſire to make Bellarmin ſeeme to ſtand for the doctrine of his Church) but onelie that Bellarmin ſpeaketh there of confidence in merits according to the ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue declared.</p>
                     <p>And thus Sir Humfrey hauing cited all he can, which all neuertheleſſe is iuſte nothing, he addeth for all this that he wondreth why the Romaniſts should ſend out ſuch Anathemas &amp; curſes againſt all or anie of thoſe that denie their doctrine. But I wonder more that he who hath produced nothing either in this chapter or in the reſt of his booke out of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike authours which in his ſenſe &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth not rather deſerue to be hiſſed at, then to be admitted for anie proofe of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yet should not be ashamed to affirme that the beſt learned of the Romaniſts confeſſe
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:2119:237"/> that manie principall points of their owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion &amp; manie articles of their faith, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancient, ſafe, nor Catholike. And ſuerlie I can not conceiue but that both he &amp; who ſoeuer els should vſe ſo much falſe dealing as he hath done, in propugning their owne tenets eſpeciallie in matters of religion, deſerue the Anathema in the higheſt degree, that curſe being the proper brande of the defenders of erroneous, hereticall, or ſcyſmaticall doctrine. And indeed it ſeemes Sir Humfrey had not verie great conference in the induſtrie which he hath vſed in this his worke. For notob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it appeareth manifeſtlie that he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the greateſt ſtreingth of his proofes through out his whole booke in the multitude of authours eſpeciallie Romaniſts, whome by way of emendication or begerie he alledgeth as confeſſers of his faith, yet he here flyeth to the little flock &amp; to the paucitie of beleeuers &amp; to the ſimplicitie of babes as to ſpeciall cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of the true Church, &amp; vtterlie diſclaming from humane wiſdome, power, &amp; nobilitie: a pore refuge after ſo manie great boaſts &amp; bragges of the victorie obteined (as he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but falſelie) by meere authoritie &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicitie of teſtimonies piled vp both in text, &amp; margin; now to plead paucitie, ſimplicitie &amp; want of power, &amp; wiſdome. And as for your paucitie in number Sir Humfrey I will not
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:2119:238"/> ſtick to graunt in regard that how great a shewe ſoeuer you haue made to the contrarie, yet I knowe you to be moſt pore &amp; beggerlie in that nature, but yet I denie that to be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall &amp; infallible marke of the true Church as you inſinuate, no more then the paucitie of Manicheans or Donatiſts was a marke of the truth of their Churches. And the ſame I ſay of the want of might, wiſdome, nobilitie, I meane of true, power, wiſdome, &amp; nobilitie, for of power, wiſdome &amp; nobilitie of the flesh you muſt needs haue much more then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, in regarde it is well knowne you both handle &amp; eate farre greater quantitie then they doe, witneſſe your little abſtinence &amp; the reſt which modeſtie cauſeth mee to paſſe in ſilence: And touching your ſimplicitie except by ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie you meane plaine ignorance, you haue no colour here to bragge of it, for that there was neuer flock in the world, in my opinion, ſo full of all ſortes of duplicitie as your owne. Neither hath anie man greater reight to be a sheepe of that fould then the noble knight Sir Humfrey, who out of the abundance of his double dealing euen in this place, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which is paſte, hath made choiſe of as falſe &amp; fallacious markes of his owne Church as he hath calumniouſlie fained mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes for ours to wit counterfeit miracles which neuertheleſſe wee diſclame from &amp; deteſt more
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:2119:238"/> then he and all his conſortes. And if they will needs medle of theſe matters, let them reflect vpon their Maſter Caluin how faine he would haue confirmed his newe Goſpell with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged reſuſcitation of a pore man who by his inſtructions, fained death, but the falſe Prophet fayling of his purpoſe committed a murder in ſteed of a miracle.</p>
                     <p>The knight ſaith further that we beleeue lyes: But I ſay that he doth not onely beleeue them but makes them, as appeares by this his pamphlet in which, as we ſee, ther is great ſtore. <note place="margin">In Deut. 14.</note> We doe not deny with Lira but that ſome times in the Church there may be great decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people among the Preiſts in fained miracles: but theſe miracles if anie ſuch ther be, are in the Church &amp; in the Preiſts onely, as Lira diſcretely inſinuate, not approued by the Church, &amp; the Preiſts or their companions for lucre, as the falſe knight iniuriouſly affirmes, moſt corruptedly omitting in his tranſlation of Lyra's wordes both the worde <hi>aliquando</hi> in the begining, &amp; alſo the end of his ſentence to wit: <note place="margin">Lyra in c. 14.

                        <note place="margin">De ciuit. l. 2. c. 8.</note> And we yet further affirme with S. Auguſtin that he that ſeeketh to be confirmed by miracles nowe, is to be wondered at moſt of all himſelfe in refuſing to beleeue what all the world beleeueth beſides himſelfe. But in thoſe wordes S. Auguſtin doth
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:2119:239"/> not deny but that true miracles may be in the Church, nor yet that they were not in his time, <note place="margin">Lib. 22. c. 8.</note> for in his bookes de Ciuit. he affirmeth expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely that Chriſtian doctrine, not onely in the begining but alſo in the progreſſe, of the Church was confirmed by miracles, as beſides other places the very title of that ſame chapter rehearſed in my margen makes appeare to which theſe his wordes in the diſcourſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing plainely agree. <note place="margin">

And by this it appeareth that S. Auguſtin is here imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently alledged by the knight. But the trueth is that becauſe theſe companions haue no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in their owne Church, they ſtriue by all meanes poſſible to obſcure the miracles of the Church of Rome &amp; crye out like Bedlames: ther is no need of miracles.</p>

                     <p>SIR Humfrey playeth the parte of a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latan ſo farre that he is not content by his preſtigious trickes &amp; ſleights to laie clame to ancient Fathers &amp; moderne Romaniſts for confeſſors of his owne faith, but alſo out of the groaſenes of his education, in this ſection he preſumeth to laie his greaſie handes vpon thoſe holie primatiue martyres, &amp; champions of Ieſus Chriſt ingroſſing &amp; conueying thoſe ſacred wares into his owne ſtincking ſtore-houſe, which neuertheleſſe all ages, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, all nations haue till the dayes of Luther proclamed &amp; teſtified to pertaine to the renowne &amp; glorie of the Roman Church. And altho' he would ſeeme to proue that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid prime martyrs doe not belong to the Church of Rome, yet his cheefe proofe is but prating &amp; an idle application of his owne te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets alreadie examined &amp; confuted in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:2119:240"/> places, where they haue ben all founde either plainelie falſe, or at the leaſt equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call &amp; founded vpon falſe ſuppoſitions vpon which no true argument can be framed: which being ſo I may iuſtelie ſaue labour to deſcend to particulars, yet one onelie wil I ſpecifie which is ſo shamefullie impertinent that it is ſufficient alone to shame the reſt.</p>
                     <p>He ſayth therefore that Father Garnet being demaunded whether if he were to conſecrate the Sacrament that morning he should ſuffer death, he durſt after conſecration affirme vpon his Saluation that the wine in the cup conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated was the verie blood of Chriſt which flowed from his ſide, he made anſere it might iuſtelie be doubted. This is the wiſe ſtorie which Sir Humfrey telleth vs out of Bishop Andrewes, which altho' wee are not bounde to beleeue as being iuſtified onelie by our aduerſaries, yet ſuppoſe it is as true as their Goſpell, it maketh not anie thing for this purpoſe, for that Sir Humfreys taske in this place was not to medle with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of theſe later ages, but to demonſtrate that thoſe ancient martyrs of former ages did not die for that fayth which the preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church profeſſeth, &amp; ſo what ſoeuer he or his Prelate can faigne of Father Garnet is but a fooles boult which flying at randome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not neare the marke. Father Garnet
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:2119:240"/> ſayth hee, durſt not pronounce openlie ouer the cup after he had conſecrated it, this is the bloud of Chriſt, <hi>ergo</hi> neuer anie martyr did take it vpon his death that the conſecrated bread is the corporall &amp; reall flesh of Chriſt. Behould I praye this moſt ſubtill Logike of a knight &amp; admire it. Or if you liſt rather laffe at it as I did when I founde it out, &amp; ſo I lefte it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie further confutation, imagining that perhaps Sir Humfrey lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before he was borne did miraculouſlie ſpeake with ſome of thoſe ancient ſouldiers of Chriſt, &amp; ſo came to knowe that none of them euer gaue their liues for the reall preſence. Which in deed is the point in queſtion, &amp; not whether a man can lawfullie pronounce vpon his Saluation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this or that hoſte in particular after conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, containeth the bodie of Chriſt, as the knight captiouſlie ſuppoſeth</p>
                     <p>But yet shewing vs ſome more graines of his follie he ſayth further, that it is vndoubtedlie true that the ancient martyrs could not dye in that fayth nor for that religion which was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnknowne to their church. O ingenious ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tilman! but yet I pray tell me if the fore ſayd martyrs dyed not for the Romaniſts religion becauſe as you faigne, they dyed not for the profeſſion of the reall preſence, For what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion did they dye? Suerlie not for yours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was vnknowne vnto them,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:2119:241"/> much more was yours vnknowne to their ages which was not in the world before the daies of Luther, except perhaps your 39. articles were knowne vnto them by extraordinarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation before they were coyned. It is true here we haue Sir Humfreys <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his tenet, &amp; ſo it muſt needs be doubtleſſe, his authority is ſo exceſſiuely great. <note place="margin">Sir Tho. Ouerb. in his caract. of a Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſian.</note> And ſo I graunt the hypotheticall to be moſt true: And me thinkes it is not much vnlike to an other ſuch like poſition of the Puritans, who vſe to ſay: it is vnpoſſible for a man to be damned in their religion, &amp; ſo a facetious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant confeſſes for certaine, as long as heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in it, but if he dyes in it, ther's the queſtion. Wherefore ſince all is but trifles that Sir Humfrey bringeth, I wish the reader of his booke to conſider with himſelfe how ſmale probabilitie there is to imagin that thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious champions of Chriſt who ſo valerouſlie ſuffered torments &amp; died for him in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, &amp; manie of them at Rome it ſelfe, could poſſiblie belong to anie other Church in the world, then to that Church which as in that tyme it had the name of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church ſo doth it ſtill remaine with the ſame appellation not otherwiſe then by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſucceſſion of the Popes of Rome, three &amp; thirtie of which (as eloquent Campian tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie obſerueth) were put to death for their faith,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:2119:241"/> which their faith as it is manifeſt partlie by their owne workes, &amp; partelie by the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall hiſtories of their martyrdomes, was the verie ſame according to the manner I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared, which nowe is tought in the preſent Church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>And if this be not ſo, if thoſe glorious mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs were not defenders of that Roman faith which by ſucceſſion of paſtours is deriued &amp; arriued to this our time, I demaund of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries of what other faith they were, for of the reformed faith they could not poſſible bee in regarde that none of them either tought in their life, or died for the defence of Iuſtification by faith onelie, or for the deniall of the reall preſence of the bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, nor for denying that there is anie other worde of God but onelie ſcripture. Nor for affirming that the images of Chriſt &amp; his Saints are Idols, or that they who honore them adore idols, or ſtickes &amp; ſtones, or that the Pope was Antichriſt: nor doe wee finde in anie hiſtorie either anie of this, nor yet that the foreſayd martyrs ſuffered for theſe, or anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther point of the reformers doctrine which is contrarie to the faith of the preſent Roman Church. Wherefore the ſayd reformers muſt neceſſarilie confeſſe that the ancient martyrs died either for ours or for no other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine, &amp; conſequentlie that they are
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:2119:242"/> eyther ours or no martyrs at all.</p>
                     <p>And if they were Popes of Rome as you Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s your ſelues ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not denie, how could they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible be yours who beleeue the Pope is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, &amp; are ſo farre from that kynde of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that you doe not willingly admit eyther Pope, Prince, or Prelate, but onelie a conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Anarchie without head or feet. And he that shall duelie ponder theſe particulars, doubtleſſe his conſcience will tell him howe vniuſtelie Sir Humfrey indeuoreth to wreiſt from the Roman Church thoſe rich priſes.

                     <p>THE 17. ſection containeth an anſere to an obiection of the Romaniſts drawne from the opinion of Proteſtants touching the Saluation of profeſſed Romaniſts, where Sir Humfrey telleth vs, he is come to the greateſt wonder. And I confeſſe the wonder which the knight propoſeth is great, but it being of his owne making, it is not hee that ought to wonder at it but rather in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he should leaue that to others.

And thus he runneth a long betweene bleſſing &amp; curſing till he concludes caſting the curſes vpon the Romaniſts &amp; the bleſſings vpon his owne Congregation. But becauſe ther is little or nothing but ſuch falſe ſtuffe as I haue alreadie examined &amp; ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſured, &amp; becauſe I haue quite ſurfeited with ſo freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame ſubiect: I onely ſaye in generall, as he is bleſſed whoe heareth or obeyeth the Church in all things in regarde that by obeying the Church he obeyeth Chriſt whoe bleſſeth them that obey him: So contrarily he that diſobeyeth the Church in one onely thing he is accurſed according to the wordes of Chriſt him helfe, if he will not heare the Church let him be vnto to the, like an Ethnike or Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. <note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> And ſo Sir Humfrey had no reaſon to maruell if the Romaniſts accounte him &amp; his fellowes accurſed becauſe they refuſe to imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce &amp; obey anie point of that doctrine which the moſt vniuerſall Church of the worlde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth vnto them as doctrine to be receiued, beleeued, or practized by all faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And as S. Auguſtin in the 41. of his fiftie homilies ſaith. Whoſoeuer is ſeparated frome the Catholique Church that is to ſay that Church which ſpred in ouer the whole worlde (as he ſpecifieth in the precedent wordes) how laudably ſoeuer he thinkes he
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:2119:244"/> liueth, for that onely ſinne that he is diuided from the vnity of Chriſt he shall not obteine life eternall, but the wrath of God remaineth vpon him.

                     <p>And according to this the Romaniſts may bouldly ſay they are accurſed whoe deny all merit in workes proceeding from the grace of God, <note place="margin">Scr. 68. in Cant.</note> &amp; they bleſſed with Sainct Bernard (whom Caluin himſelfe calleth a holye &amp; pious man) that affirme with him that <hi>it is a pernicious prouertie to want merits,</hi> &amp; yet eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the houre of their death for humilitie with the ſame S.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:2119:246"/> is ment onelie by inuincible ignorance, &amp; ſo by his owne comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie he corrupted the whole text. And if this be the beſt conſtruction his charitie can afford wee will thanke him for it as much is it deſerueth. Neuertheleſſe it is no matter what either Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey or his fellowes ſay in this point, wee eſteeme not ſo much of there iudgements as to frame out of them, anie rule for the ſafe way of ſaluation: for this rule, wee had long before their Church was built wee had it frome the way maker him ſelfe. And I tell you by the way Sir Humfrey that if any of your Church be ſaued in the manner I haue declared in the begining of this Period, they are abſolutely ſaid to be ſaued in our Church not in yours, thoguh exteriorlie they liue &amp; dye in yours. And ſo to conclud, if you will not permit the Romaniſts to drawe an argument from the confeſſion of ſome of your authours, but will needs affirme with your greateſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour &amp; Arch Puritan whitaker, that vpon his worde ther is not one Papiſt to be founde in Heauen, I for my parte vpon condition you brag not of a victorie as you vſe to doe, I will not contend with you, but as in a matter nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of faith, nor yet of anie great conſequence ſuppoſing your owne peruerſe gloſſes, I leaue you to your owne ſenſe, as alſo I doe thoſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts whoe vſed that argument againſt ſome of their aduerſaries.</p>

                     <head>THE XVII. PERIOD.</head>
                     <p>SIr Humfrey hath played the Iacke ſo long that in this his laſt ſection he playeth Iacke on both ſides, telling vs in the title that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to showe that the Proteſtant religion is ſafer by the confeſſion of both parties, that is, both of Romaniſts &amp; Reformers.</p>
                     <p>But I knowe not to what end he made this ſection except is was onely to make the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his ſections eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for I finde nothing in it but a new repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of old matters ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alredy inculcated that my eares are wearie to heare them. And if Sir Humfrey was diſpoſed to playe in the number, he ought rather to haue made choiſe of the od nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the euen as being in the Poets opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more pleaſing to God, <hi>Deus numero inpare gaudet.</hi> But let this paſſe, for how ſoeuer hee doth, I for my parte deſire not to ſtand vpon numbers but vpon ſubſtance. If he had brought either newe matter, or at the leaſt, ſome new proofe of the old, it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps haue ben worth the labour to examen it, but I finde onely old matter &amp; newe equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, ſleights, &amp; falſities, &amp; theſe onely I will breefely diſcuſſe.</p>
                     <p>But the whole drift of the knight in this his laſt ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, as he ſaith him ſelfe, to make good the title of his booke, which is that therfore
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:2119:247"/> hee &amp; his fellowes are in the ſafer way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe quotteth he, the Romaniſts agree with vs in the principall points of doctrine: &amp; becauſe that is the ſafer way wherin differing partes ioyne both in one, &amp; this I hould to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his whole diſcourſe if anie ther were to be founde in it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore he telleth vs great newes to wit that there is a Heauen &amp; a hell, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of which, ſayth hee, wee both agree, &amp; thence he concludeth that this is the ſafer way becauſe both ſides ioine in it. But this, if you marke it, is meere Sophiſtrie, for in ſtead of a whole way both in this particular and in the reſt of the points of controuerſie he paſſeth throu' in this ſection, he sheweth but a peece of a way. The whole way which he ought to shewe in this one point is the reformers beleefe of heauen &amp; hell &amp; their denyall of Purgatory &amp; limbus, Now Sir Humfrey putteth in tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt parte of his way to wit, the reformers beleefe of heauen &amp; hell, (how true this is I knowe not) but he leaueth out deceitfullie the ſecond parte of the way viz. the Reformers beleefe in the denyall of Purgatorie &amp; Limbus, &amp; ſo as I ſayd before in ſtead of the whole way he sheweth but a peece, which peece altho' it be ſuppoſed to be neuer ſo ſafe, yet it will not ſerue the turne to bring a man to his iourneys end, nor yealdeth him anie more certaintie or
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:2119:248"/> ſaftie in his way then he that should tell one who is vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his iourney to yorke, that his ſafeſt way is to goe from London to Iſlinton, &amp; there should leaue him to shifte for himſelfe for his directions in the reſt of the way, in which caſe certaine it is the traueller should be little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing obledged to him who shewes him that parte of the way onelie which all the world knoweth. And the trueth is that Sir Humfrey argueth in this whole matter as if he should ſay of himſelfe &amp; his fellow reformers, we &amp; the Turkes agree in the creed of one God &amp; differ in the beleefe of Chriſt the Meſſias, therefore it is the ſafer way to beleeue onelie in one God in which wee all agree, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in God &amp; Chriſt too, in which wee ſtand ſingle. Euen ſo concludeth the knight of the faith of Purgatorie, Limbus, &amp; the reſt of the points in controuerſy which he particularizeth in the diſcourſe of this ſection, arguing no otherwiſe then in this abſurde manner. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it, ô Sir Humfrey, our ſtanding ſingle by our ſelues, or double with you that eyther maketh or marreth either the faith of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, or anie other article of the Roman do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as you falſelie &amp; fallaciouſlie ſuppoſe in your argument: But ſcriptures, generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, Fathers &amp; the authoritie of the moſt vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church are the pilars vpon which the houſe of our faith is built.</p>
                     <pb n="497" facs="tcp:2119:248"/>
                     <p>And as for your ioyning with vs in anie one article, or els in the generall aſſertion of ſome of your authours that wee may be ſaued in our Church, how ſoeuer it may ſeeme to ſome to be a confirmation of our faith, yet it is not anie parte of the foundation of our faith, but onelie a kynde of morall argument or motiue that we are in the ſafer way becauſe euen ſome of our aduerſaries themſelues hould we may be ſaued in it. But yet as this alone, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we did faile in the true grounds of our faith themſelues, can not be a ſufficient proofe that we are in the ſafer way then you, ſo ought it not to be a ſufficient proofe that you are in the ſafer way becauſe we agree with you in ſome parte of your doctrine. Eſpeciallie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering you faile in the cheefe grounds of your faith as hath ben shewed partelie in my this ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſure, &amp; partelie by other Catholike diuines in their ſeuerall workes. And if anie argument for the greater ſafetie of your way could be drawne from our agreement with you in ſome points of faith, ſo in like manner might we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a proofe of the greater ſaftie of our way from the certaintie of thoſe points of faith in which you agree with vs, all which is but nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, friuolous, &amp; abſurd in regarde that as, <hi>a parte ad totum,</hi> from a parte to the whole no lawfull deduction can be made, ſo neyther can it be inferred that becauſe one parte of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:2119:249"/> of a mans faith is true, therefore the whole obiect of is faith is true by reaſon that notob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding one parte of the obiect be true, yet there may be in the whole obiect or matter trueth &amp; falſitie mixed together, of which we haue inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces both in diuine &amp; humane matters.</p>
                     <p>And more then this, Sir Humfrey muſt giue vs licence to tell him that he was to forward in the proofe of his tenet. For before he went aboute to proue his way to be ſafer then ours, he ought firſt to haue conuinced his owne way to be a true &amp; perfect way, &amp; not to haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his reader a parte for the whole by a falſe Senecdoche, or contrarie to the Grammer ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to obtrude vpon him a comparatiue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a poſitiue, that is a ſafer way were no way is to be found at all, or at the leaſt no ſafe &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre way. And yet more ouer it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that beſides thoſe poſitiue points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in which he ſayth that both partes agree, there be alſo diuers negatiues which they quite diſtinguish one from an other, which negatiues neuertheleſſe are parte of the reformers faith as well as their poſitiue doctrine, &amp; ſo in this parte of their Creed they ſtand ſingle as well as we, &amp; conſequentlie if ſtanding ſingle, as he auerreth or at the leaſt ſuppoſeth, doth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſafetie of our way, the ſame effect it muſt of neceſſitie haue in theirs, &amp; according to this ground of Sir Humfreys it is manifeſt
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:2119:249"/> that the reformers can neuer haue the ſafer way till we ioyne with them in euerie point thereof by that meanes to hinder their ſingle ſtanding, which yet we aſſure our ſelues will neuer come to paſſe, except God almightie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to vs from whome they once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, as we greatlie deſire &amp; daylie praye.</p>
                     <p>And according to this wee may breeflie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſere to all the reſt of the inſtances which the knight produceth. And ſo we Romaniſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe we ſtand with the reformers in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of heauen &amp; hell, but we ſtand not with them in the deniall of Purgatorie <hi>&amp; lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> We ſtand with them in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the merits and ſatisfactions of Ieſus Chriſt: But we ſtand not with them in the negation of the merits &amp; ſatisfactions of thoſe that liue in the grace of God, &amp; by the virtue of the ſame &amp; the cooperation of their owne free will, performe good workes of charitie, mercie, iuſtice, &amp; the like, houlding for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine with S. Auguſtin that he who created vs without vs, will not ſaue vs without vs: yet further aſſuring our ſelues that God doth not operate with beſts &amp; men both in one manner. We ſtand with them in the defence of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme &amp; Euchariſt ſo farre as they Orthodoxlie maintainte them, but we ſtand not with them in the impugnation of the other fiue Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:2119:250"/> We ſtand with them in that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the images of Chriſt &amp; his Saints are ornaments &amp; memorialls of the abſent: but we ſtand not with them in their denyall of due honour to be exhibited vnto them for the great loue &amp; reuerence we beare to Chriſt &amp; his Saints. We ſtand with them in the defence of the diuine worship of God: but we ſtand not with them in the denyall of interceſſiue inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation &amp; honour of his Saints. We ſtand with them in that Chriſt is the prime mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God &amp; man: but we ſtand not with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their denyall of the ſecondarie mediators, or interceſſors which are his ſeruants &amp; frends. We ſtand with them in that Chriſt is head Monarch of the whole Church triumphant &amp; militant: but we ſtand not with them in their denyall of the viſible &amp; Vicarious head the Pope or cheefe paſtour of the viſible Church in earth ſubordinate &amp; ſubiet to Chriſt in the gouernement of the ſame. We will not refuſe to ſtand with them in that they graunt that S. Peter had a Primacie of Order: but we ſtand not with then in that they denie his Primacie of power &amp; Iuriſdiction. We ſtand with them in that they teach there are 22. bookes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall ſcripture: but we ſtand not with them in the refuſall of the booke of Tobie, Iudith, two firſt bookes of Machabees, the booke of
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:2119:250"/> wiſdome, Eſdras &amp; Baruch the Prophet. We ſtand with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that they affirme the ſcripture is the rule of faith: But we ſtand not with them in their denyall of diuine traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, not properly added to the ſcriptures but commended by them &amp; included in them in a general manner. We ſtand with them in that they ſay there are twelue articles of the Creed: But we ſtand not with them in their denyall of the reſt of the doctrine defined in generall Councells: as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we ioyne with them in the defence of all the 39. Articles of the English faith or Creed.</p>
                     <p>And ſo now by theſe particulars the iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reader may euidentlie perceiue that by reaſon the Romaniſts agree with the knight onelie in ſome parte or partiall of his doctrine, he could not poſſible proue by their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the greater ſafetie of his way, as both in the title of this his laſt ſection, &amp; alſo in the title of his whole booke he did propoſe. Nay he is ſo farre from the proofe of this, that he hath moſt apparentlie fayled in the proofe of the verie argument of his whole worke which to the end it may more plainelie appeare I will reduce to this Sylogiſme.</p>
                     <p>That faith is the ſafe way leading all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to the true, ancient &amp; Catholike faith, which is proued by the confeſſions &amp; teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:2119:251"/> of the beſt learned Romaniſts to haue ben viſible in all ages eſpeciallie before the dayes of Luther. But the faith now profeſſed in the Church of England, is proued by the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions &amp; teſtimonies of the beſt learned Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts to haue ben viſible in all ages eſpeciallie before the dayes of Luther. Therefore the faith now profeſſed in the Church of England is the ſafe way leading all Chriſtians to the true, ancient, &amp; Catholike faith.</p>
                     <p>Now there being contained in the minor of this Sylogiſme the whole argument, purpoſe, &amp; drift of Sir Humfreys whole booke, &amp; yet neuertheleſſe it hauing ben by mee in this my cenſure demonſtrated not to haue ben proued and made good by anie argument by him produced, all he produceth to that purpoſe being voyde of force as by the diſcuſſion of the particulars of euerie ſection the reader may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie vnderſtand, it followeth by a neceſſarie ſequele that his way can not be ſafe, but is to be auoyded with moſt great care &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection as a falſe &amp; erroneous path, by all thoſe that tender the ſafetie of their ſoules &amp; eternall Saluation.</p>
                     <p>And thus hauing now reſolued the man into his principles or prime matter I meane into the duſt &amp; ashes which he caſteth in his reader eyes: &amp; hauing paſſed throu' all the paſſages of
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:2119:251"/> his imaginarie ſafe way, I haue founde it &amp; shewed it to be no way at all, but an intricate diuerticle or obſcure path leading pore diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed trauellers quite out of the true royall ſtreet with an impoſſibilite euer to come to the end of their iourney, that is to the true ancient Catholike faith, which faith altho' the knight both in the title of his booke &amp; in diuers other places of it, hath ſeriouſlie promiſed to shew it to be the ſame which is now profeſſed in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, euen by the confeſſion of the Romaniſts yet haue I made it manifeſt that no true Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt that is no authour which is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Roman Church for a member of the ſame, did either in generall or in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular euer confeſſe the foreſaid faith of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to be the ancient Catholike faith, or that did euer, abſolutelie &amp; in the ſame ſenſe in which the reformed Churches doe, defende anie one article of the pretenſiue reformed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in matter of faith or generallie defined manners. In regard of which &amp; becauſe my cheefe intent was when I firſt reſolued to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this buſines out of a tender compaſſion to free the readers from the great &amp; generall deluſion which I vnderſtood this pamphlet of Sir Humfreys had cauſed, or might hereafter cauſe in the myndes of manie, &amp; eſpeciallie the more vnlearned ſorte of people, altho' in
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:2119:252"/> verie truth in itſelfe it containeth nothing worth the labour of a ſcholler, I doe now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertice them as they eſteeme the ſaftie of their ſoules, to beware of it as of a shop of moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitelie &amp; poyſonous drugges of which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ſafety taſte without an antidote, I meane the illiterate or vnexperienced perſons in this kynde of ſtudie, can not ſecurelie reade the the booke except with all they view the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe parte, &amp; ſo by detection of the authours fraudes, &amp; couning deceipts they behould the truth diſcouered, which otherwiſe as being moſt ſubtillie inuolued &amp; mixed by him with abundance of plauſible vntruthes, equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, falſe ſuppoſitions &amp; Sophiſmes, can hardlie be founde out euen by thoſe of greater learning &amp; capacitie then ordinarilie the laytie vſe to be.</p>
                     <p>And as for Sir Humfrey him ſelfe, altho' I haue ſmale hope of his reclamation in regard of the great arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy which I perceiue in him, as being mightily blinded with the vanity of his owne conceite, <note place="margin">If truly the worke is this.</note> yet will I not omit to crie a loude vnto him with the ſacred pſalmiſt, <hi>vtinam ſaperet &amp; intelligeret, ac nouiſsima pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideret,</hi> would to God he would ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that there will come a time when his booke shall paſſe a farre more ſtrict examen &amp; ſentence of condemnation then here it hath
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:2119:252"/> paſſed, or can poſſible paſſe in this mortall life. And yet if perhaps he findes in the anſwere of it, any more sharpe or vnpleaſing ſpeaches then he would willingly heare, I earneſtly intreate him to account them not as ſpoken againſt his perſon, but preciſely as he is infected with the ſpirituall plague of ſchiſme &amp; hereſie, and as whoſe conuerſion to the moſt vniuerſally florishing Church an faith (notobſtanding whatſoeuer wordes haue paſſed in heate of diſputation) I earneſtely deſire &amp; praye for. And with this deſire &amp; affection I commend him to the infinit goodneſſe &amp; mercy of all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God.</p>

                  <p>From S.

                  <p>They diſſent alſoe from the ſcripture both in that thoſe wordes which they put for the ſecond Commaundement, the ſcripture ſetteth them downe in the very ſame tenor &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of ſtyle with thoſe which according to both parties is the firſt Commaundement, to wit: <hi>Thou shalt haue no other Gods but me,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſoe one &amp; the ſame punishment after that which the Reformers will needs haue to be an other Commaundement, which yet if they were diſtinct commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, they should

                  <p>As alſo ſecondly becauſe in the text of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus out of which the reformers rehearſe their Commaundements, the words are not, as they corruptedly tranſlate &amp; relate them. <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen image,</hi> but: <hi>thou shalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen thing.</hi> Which is yet more plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated in the fourth of the Deut. to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not ſo that there ought not any grauen ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude to be made, but that ther ought not anie to be made of thoſe things which God prohibited, eſpecially ſuppoſing that the Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomie as the word it ſelfe doth ſignifie, is an exacte explication of the lawe Exodus, &amp; that that which in the firſt Commaundement is forbiden in the Exodus, in the 26. of the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus the ſame is declared to be <hi>idolum, &amp; ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> that is an idol &amp; a grauen thing.</p>

                  <p>I Requeſt the reader of my Cenſure ſo take notice of ſome particulars which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred ſince the finishing of it.</p>
                  <p>And imprimis touching the homilie and epiſtles alledged by Sir Humfrey in the 9. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his ſafe way againſt the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and tranſſubſtantion, I anſered in the 8.

For all thoſe whoe reioyce to be called, and to bee Chriſtians, doe glorie in that they receiue in this ſacrament the true fleſh and bloud of Chriſts bodie receiued from the virgin. Inquire of all ſuch as haue knouledge of the latin tongue, and of our writings. Inquire of the Grecians, Armenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or of Chriſtian people of anie nation what ſoeuer, &amp; they will with one mouth teſtifye that they haue this faith. Furthermore if the faith of the vniuerſall church be falſe, either ther neuer was Catholique church, or ſhe hath periſhed. nothing is more efficati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the periſhing of ſoules then a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious error. But no Catholique will graunt that the church either was not, or that ſhe hath periſhed. In this plaine ſorte teſtifyes Lanfranc of the faith of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall church in which it were madnes to imagine he did not include his owne I meane the church of England. And ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he liued &amp; writ this the verie next age following the age in which Alfric dyed to wit in ſome parte of the leue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th centurie, it is more then monſterous impudencie in our

                  <p>Further more.

                     <hi>Caenantibus autem illis &amp;c.</hi> In all which writings Paſcaſius moſt plainely defendeth both the reall preſence and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, moſt frequently repeating and inculcating that the ſame bodie and bloud which Chriſt receiued of the Virgin Marie, and the ſame in which he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, is really and truely preſent in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt and offered in ſacrifice. I need not relate his wordes for euerie particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I knowe our aduerſaries can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye but that this Author is plainely for the Romaniſts and flat againſt them in thoſe points of doctrine: onely I will rehearſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me generall wordes of his in which he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res the faith of the vniuerſall church in and before his tymes: for after teſtimonies of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers alledged to this purpoſe in
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:2119:260"/> the concluſion of the foreſaid wordes of S. Mathewe thus he ſaith. <hi>Ecce habes amantiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me &amp;c.</hi> Behould moſt louing brother, thou haſte in the end of this little booke the ſentences of the Catholique Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſly noted, by which thou maiſt learne that I haue not ſeene ſuch things in raſhnes of ſpeech when I was a child, but that I haue propoſed them by diuine authoritie, and by the authoritie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Fathers to ſuch as demaunded them. But now it being cleare that Since that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the faith of all men is not one and the ſame, then ceaſe I praye to beleeue with ſuch as they bee, if as yet they can not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that nothing is impoſſible to God, and lett them learne to aſſent vnto the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne wurdes in all things, &amp; to doubt nothing of thoſe: For till this preſent no man is read to haue erred in them except thoſe whoe erred aboute Chriſt himſelfe: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſtanding manie doubted or haue ben ignorant of the Sacraments of ſoe great a Myſterie: And afterwardes the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in the ſame treatiſe ſaith thus. <hi>Qua ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleta voce, &amp;c.</hi> Which wordes being prono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unced (meaning the wordes of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) we all with one conſonant voyce ſay. Amen.</p>
                  <p>And ſoe the whole Church in all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:2119:260"/> and languages doth pray and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, that it is that thing which ſhe prayeth for, wherby let him whoe will rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this then beleeue it regarde what he doth againſt our lord him ſelf, againſt the whole Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Therfore it is a nefarious and deteſtable villanie to pray with all and not to beleeue that which truth it ſelf doth teſtifye, and that which vniuerſally all in euerie place doe teach. Whence it is that ſince he him ſelfe affirmes it is his bodie and his bloud, doubt ought not to be made in anie thing, altho' we ſee not with carnall yes that which we beleeue. We haue ſeene alſoe what Pope Gregorie houldeth of this, what S. Cyrill with all his fellow Biſhops aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Epheſus, what Greece with them, what Egipt, and what S. Hierome him ſelf whoe publiſhed the liues of the holye Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in latin. And therfore not obſtanding ſome erre in this by ignorance neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe as yet ther is none that openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictes that which the whole world doth beleeue &amp; confeſſe. Thus Paſcaſius a learned and venerable, and virtuous Abbat teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth the faith of the vniuerſall Church in his dayes touching the reall preſence, of Chriſt in the Euchariſt. Whoe altho'
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:2119:261"/> he was not English nor liued iuſte in the tyme of Alfric, yet he liued within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the ſame age in which Alfric was Biſhop of wilton and Archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie that is the yeare 900. yea it may be Paſcaſius was yet aliue whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Alfric was Abbat and conſequently when he is ſuppoſed by our aduerſaries to haue writ thoſe epiſtles which they produce in his name concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter. Soe that by this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Paſcaſius a forcible argument is made that the contrarie doctrine of the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence cauld not poſſible haue ben ſoe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick and common in anie parte of the Chriſtian world in ſoe shorte a ſpace of tyme as paſſed, (if anie paſſed) betwixt Paſcaſius and the writing of the homilie and Epiſtles attributed to Alfric if he did- euer write them.</p>
                  <p>And how beit is may appeare by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Paſcaſius that ther were ſome in, or aboute his tyme whoe argued &amp; writ in an vnacuſtomed and new manner touching the doctrine of the preſence of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud in the Sacrament as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Ioannes, Scotus, Bertrame and Frude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, yet as much as I can perceiue by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſcaſius, Fulbertus, Stephanus Edue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſis, &amp; others whoe writ of this matter, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achers of this queſtion did neuer abſolutely
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:2119:261"/> auerre and maintaine anie aſſertion directly repugnant to the true, and reall exiſtence of Chriſts bodie and bloud in the Euchariſt, but onely made a ſchoole queſtion of it arguing the matter <hi>pro and contra:</hi> and that not determinately of the reall preſence, but whether the ſame bodie, &amp; bloud of Chriſt which was borne of the Virgin Marie &amp; was crucifyed vpon the Croſſe, was contained vnder the formes of bread and wine in the Sacrament, &amp; not rather ſome other kynd of Chriſts bodie and bloud, yet truely his and truely preſent in the Euchariſt, thou in a figuratiue and tropicall manner.</p>
                  <p>And that neither the named authors nor anie other in or aboute Paſcaſius tyme did plainely or of ſet purpoſe impugne the reall preſence, it plainely appeares by his wordes aboue cited affirming that <hi>not obſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anding ſome erred by ignorance, yet that none did openly contradict that which the whole world did beleeue and confeſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is yet further confirmed, for we read not that either Scotus, Frudegard, or Bertrame were euer condemned by the Church in their perſons in anie Councell, or otherwiſe, which is an euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſigne they were not obſtinate in defence of their opinions, but onely deliuered their doubts by way of propoſition, as at the leaſt in Frudegard
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:2119:262"/> in particular, doth manifeſtly appeare by the reſponſion of Paſcaſius to his Epiſtle, ſaying thus. <hi>Quaeris enim de re ex qua multi dubitant. You inquire of a thing of which manie doubt.</hi> And for concluſion of his owne Epiſtle Paſcaſius ſaith to Frude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. <hi>Tu autem velim, relegas libellum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum de hoc opere. For I would haue you read my booke of this matter which you ſay you haue read in tymes paſt. And if you reprehend, or doubt of anie thing in it: let it not be tedious vnto you to reuiewe it.</hi> And finally towardes the end of his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wordes of the inſtitution of the Euchariſt, he ſpeaketh to Frude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in this manner. <hi>Quapropter chariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſime. Wherfore most dearely beloued doe not doubt of this Myſterie which Chriſt the truth it ſelf hath of him ſelf bestowed vpon vs. For altho' he ſits in heauen at the reight hand of his Father, yet doth he not diſdaine to be Sacrifyced dayly by the preiſt in the Sacrament as a true hoaste.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the ſame Frudegardus doubt was onely whether the bodie of Chriſt contained in the Sacrament was the ſame bodie which he aſſumed of the Virgin Marie, is plaine by Paſcaſius anſer ſaying thus almoſt in the beginning of his Epiſtle. <hi>Ergo cum ait. Wherfore when he ſaith
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:2119:262"/> this is my bodie, or my flesh, or this is my bloud. I think he intimated no other flesh then his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne propter bodie which was borne of the Virgin Marie and hanged en the Croſſe. Nor anie other bloud then that which was ſpilt vpon the Croſſe, and which then was in his bodie. No man therfore which is ſoundly wiſe doth beleeue that Ieſus had anie other flesh or bloud then that which was borne of the Virgin Marie and ſuffered vpon the Croſſe.</hi> And for concluſion of his foreſaid expoſition he ſaith thus to the ſame Frudegard. <hi>Ad vltimum quaeſo te. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtely I praye fallow not the fooleries of the tripar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite or triple bodie of Christ. Doe not mingle ſalt, nor hunnie in it, as ſome would, doe not adde nor ſubstracte anie thing, but beleeue and vnderstand it all as Chriſt instituted, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Scotus and Bertrame althou' their bookes haue hen reproued, yet it doth not fallow that their authors did directly and abſolutely impugne the reall preſence, or tranſſubſtantiation, but they onely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered their myndes in a doubtfull, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and ill ſounding manner, for which cauſe and for auoyding of danger they were iuſtely prohibited, the onely the Councell of vercelles: the other by the <hi>purgatorie Index.</hi> Howbe it I find nothing in Bertram which with a pious interpretation might
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:2119:263"/> not paſſe among the learned ſorte of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>And thus much may ſuffice for proofe that in Paſcaſius tyme ther had ben no plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne denyall of the reall preſence or tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation in the Chriſtian world, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome incident doubts made by ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, and that in a diſcuſſiue manner, not as obſtinate maintainers of ſuch Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>And now by this ſame and the reſt which I haue aboue produced out of the ſame Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſius &amp; Lanfra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c and others, the falſe Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop and Primate of Ireland is conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of an apparent falſitie, for that in the 79. page of his anſer to a Ieſuits chalenge, he had the face to affirme that til the dayes of Lanfranc this queſtion of the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence continued ſtill in debate: and that it was as free for anie man to followe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Bertram (he calles him Ratran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus) or Ioannes Scotus, as that of Paſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius. This audatious affirmation of vſher I ſay is clearly condemned of falſitie by the ſame Paſcaſius whome he citeth, and whoe as I haue alledged, teſtifyes that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the reall preſence in his tyme was not as yet contradicted by anie (except tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe whoe denye Chriſt) but beleeued and profeſſed by the whole world, althou ſome, ſaith
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:2119:263"/> he did erre in the ſame by ignorance. And this onely by way of diuertion, breefly to ſignifye to the reader how common a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it is euen among the moſt famous of our aduerſaries to maintaine their doctrine by lyes and falſe dealing of which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by a breefe vewe I tooke of ſome parte of his worke an induſtrious reader may diſcouer no ſmale ſtoare in the great primate doctor Vſher, as well as his fellowes.</p>
                  <p>But now to returne to my direct pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I yet more efficatiouſly confirme that which I haue ſaid of Alfric by the chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie of our Engliſh hiſtorians. <note place="margin">

<pb n="529" facs="tcp:2119:264"/> neither was Alfric Abbat but Archbiſhop of Canterburie, neither was either of the two wulſtans Archbiſhop of yorke at that tyme. the one being dead 40. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the other not inueſted in that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie vntill the yeare 1003. as Godwin doth witneſſe. ſoe that by this argument it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appeares that the knights relation touching this matter of the publiſhing of the homilie and Epiſtles alledged by him- againſt the reall preſence and tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is contradictious &amp; voyde of truth.</p>
                  <p>More ouer I finde in our Engliſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that aboute the yeare 950. which was ſome fortie and od yeares before Alfric was preferred to be Archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie, <note place="margin">

                     </note> in the tyme of Odo Archbiſhop of the ſame ſeat, ther were ſome conuented before him whoe were in an erroreous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion aboute the preſence of Chriſts bodie in the Euchariſt, but the maintainers of it (how ſoeuer Fox doth fable) neither were manie, nor did it long continue, but was miraculouſly at an inſtant exſtinguiſhed. For the pious &amp; zealous paſtor Odo much lamenting the illuſion of thoſe miſerable people, prayed God with teares in maſſe, that his diuine maieſtie would be pleaſed by his infinit power manifeſtely to ſhewe
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:2119:265"/> ſome thing by which both the truth of the reall preſence might appeare, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie error might be confounded, when ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely at his ſeruants petition God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie turned the conſecrated bread in to viſible fleſh, and the wine in to viſible bloud. Which wonderous ſpectacle being ſeene, the incredulous perſons preſently complained of their owne perfidie and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe, and all the reſt of their dayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued their faith intire and ſounde: now this hauing happened aboute the ſame tyme at which that wulſtan was Archbishop of yorke whoe hauing ben in that place ſome yeares: deceaſed the yeare 955. as Godwin relateth, it clearely appeares incredible that Alfric then Abbat ſhould direct anie doctrine repugnant to the reall preſence to wolſtan Archbiſhop of yorke, and to vlſine, vlſius, or wulfſtius Biſhop of ſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne, as our aduerſaries affirme, ſince that Odo Archbiſhop of Canterburie and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of England, at the verie ſame tyme, as of out of hiſtories I haue rehearſed, did by the power of God operate ſoe ſtrange a miracle in confirmation of the ſame, and confutation of the contrarie error.</p>
                  <p>More then this, Vlſin or vlſius whome the knight calles wulfſtius (of which name neuertheleſſe I finde none in Malesburies
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:2119:265"/> Catalogue of the Biſhops of Sherbourne) could not poſſible haue anie Epiſtle dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto him by Alfric while he was Abbat of Malesburie or Abington, as Sir Humfrey and the reſt of theſe tryfelers alledge, for that while Vlſine, or wulfſtius was Biſhop of Sherbourne which was but onely fiue yea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res, as our hiſtories doe teſtifye, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hrapsfeld. ſaec.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> being Abbat onely of weſtminiſter in the dayes of S. Dunſtan and by his procurement, whoſe death happened the yeare .988. as Stowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates: Alfric was no more Abbat but Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of wilton, and conſequently he could not as Abbat write to Vlſine, Vlſius, or wulf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius Biſhop of Sherbourne, but if he had writ anie ſuch letters as our aduerſaries at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vnto him, to that Biſhop, he ſhould haue ſtyled him ſelfe not Abbat, but Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop as in deed he was all the tyme yea and ſome yeares before the foreſaid wulfſtius was by king Ethelred preferred to the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopall ſeat of Sherbourne.</p>
                  <p>But that which doth ſtrik this quite dead, is that (ther hauing ben but onely twoe wolſtans Archbiſhops of yorke) the firſt wolſtan dyed before euer Alfric was Abbat, to wit the yeare of our Lord 955. wher as Ingulphus in Edgar relates Alfric to haue ben created Abbat onely aboute the yeare 970. at the ſooneſt, ſoe that he
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:2119:266"/> could not poſſible write anie Epiſtles to the firſt wolſtan while he was Abbat as our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelliſts pretend, bebauſe this wolſtan was departed out of this life before Alfrics tyme of being Abbat. And as for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond wolſtan it is well knowne and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by Godwin that he was not Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of yorke before the yeare 1003. At which tyme Alfric was not Abbat but Archbiſhop of Canterburie as our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries them ſelues refuſe not to graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</p>
                  <p>And ſoe this computation and collation of tymes vtterly deſtroyes the machination of our abuerſaries in attrituting the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid writings to Abbat Alfric.</p>
                  <p>And touching Vlſius or Vlſinus I adde to this that Alfric was conſecrated Byſhop of wilton in the yeare 985. or ther aboutes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me fourteeme yeares after the coronation of Ethelred. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de. Pont Aug. pag.</hi> 203.</note> And he ſate 11. yeares in that place as Malerburie relates. But now Vlſine as it appeares by a breef of Iohn the 15. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe of this name touching the peace he compoſed betwixt king Ethelred and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard marques of Normandie, was Byſhop of Sherbourne aboute the yeare 991. of which yeare the Popes letter carieth date, in which althou the Pope doth not call him Vlſine, but Edelſine, yet both by the tyme
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:2119:266"/> and place of his ſeat, as alſoe for that ther is noe other in the Catalogue of the Biſhops of Sherbourne yeare the after in which I finde related by Ingulpſus, Alfrics was Abbat of malesburie which reſembleth that name; it is conuinced that this is the ſame man which the kinght calleth wulfſtius, and to whome he affirmes one of Abbat Alfrics E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to haue ben directed. which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheleſſe is concluded to be falſe in regard that at that tyme of the date of the Popes Epiſtole to wit the yeare 991. Alfric was not Abbat but Biſhop, this hauing happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but fiue yeres before that Alfric then Biſhop of wilton, was aſſumpted to the Arcgbiſhoprie of Canterburie which was the yeare 996. as all agreeably teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye.</p>
                  <p>Now if our aduerſaries ſhould ſay that this Vlſius, Vlſine, or Edelſine is not that Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of Sherbourne to whome they meane that Alfric writ his Epiſtle, but an other long before him called wulfſtius.</p>
                  <p>To this I replye, firſt that I finde not this name of wulfſtius in anie author or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Biſhops of Sherbourne, and ſoe I ſuſpect it is a tricke of knight Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey whoe as it ſeemes firſt inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the name, <note place="margin">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de or for the name of anie Biſhop of that ſeat. Secondly.</p>
                  <pb n="534" facs="tcp:2119:267"/>
                  <p>It is true hiſtories make mention of one Vlſius Biſhop of that ſeat and ſucceſſor to Alfred, but neither the name agrees to knight Humfreyes feigned wulfſtius, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their was he then in the world when Alfric was Abbat, but according to the catalogue annexed to Ingulphus, deceaſed the yeare 966. For whoſe ſucceſſor the ſame catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue putteth Alfwoldus. wheres yet it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res by the teſtimonie of Ingulphus that Alfric was not Abbat till either in, or after the yeare 970. by which it is cleare he could not write to this vlſius or wulfſtius as Abbat, in reſpect he was dead ſome yeares before Alfric was preferred to that place by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointement of king Edgar. and ſoe this euaſion is intercepted by the way and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be fruſtrate and falſe.</p>
                  <p>Further more according to Biſhop Vſhers chronologie affirming that Alfric writ his homilie aboute 605. yeares a goe Alfric ſhould haue writ the ſame the yeare 1026. or ther aboutes, deriuing the accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tyme of Vſhers publicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his booke; for ſoe by putting fiue or ſix yeares which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hath paſſed ſince the tyme of Vſhers writing, to the 605. yeares which he aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for the tyme in which Alfric writ, &amp; ioining to all this 1026 or 7. the whole nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber amountes iuſt to 1632. which is the
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:2119:267"/> yeare we now liue in. But this implyes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie in regarde it is receiued by both parties that Alfric dyed the yeare 1006. that is ſome 20. yeares before 1026. which Vſher aſſignes for the yeare of Alfric's wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the homilie by which it appeares that Primate Vſher is a moſt prime yea and a moſt vnmyndefull lyer in attributing this writing to Abbat Alfric. And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the writing of Alfrics twoe ſuppoſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, if Vſher meanes they were writ and directed to wulfſine and wulſtane at this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me tyme, he is likewiſe manifeſtly conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of falſitie, for that at the tyme aſſigned by him, ther was no vlſius, vlſine or wulfſine (as he nameth him) Biſhop of ſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne in the world to whome Alfric could haue directed anie writings, the laſt of that name being dead the age before as I haue ſhewed, as alſoe the firſt wulſtan Arcbiſhop of yorke. True it is the ſecond wulſtan of yorke was then a liue to wit vnto the yeare 1023. but then Alfric being dead Archbiſhop of Canterburie (as I haue ſhowed by God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins Catalogue) almoſt 20. yeares before, the ſuppoſed direction of Epiſtles vnto him is euen in that reſpect concluded for repugnant and impoſſible with a plaine diſſent of the author from him ſelf as affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the publication of theſe writings to
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:2119:268"/> haue happened in the dayes of Alfric, &amp; yet onely aboute 605. yeares agoe.</p>
                  <p>More ouer theſe relators agrees in their Chronographie like dogges and cattes, the partes of which hange togither as theeues hang vpon the gallowes neuer a one ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an other. For as I haue ſaid, Vſher affirmes Alfric Abbat's Saxon homilie to haue ben writen by him aboute 605. yeares which according to true computation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the tyme in which Vſher writ this, comes to fall about the yeare 1020. <note place="margin">

                  <p>Againe concerning the Epiſtles attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Alfric ther is yet more diſcorde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our aduerſaries. For the publiſher of
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:2119:270"/> them and the homilie aboue mentioned in his preface vnto them affirmes ther were certaines lines rare zout of a booke extant in the librarie of worceter which lines, ſaith he, which contained the cheefe point of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie (that is as he ſuppoſeth againſt the reall preſence and tranſſubſtantiation) were taken out of twoe Epiſtles of Alfric written by him as well in the Saxon tongue as in the latin. But Doctor Iames and Sir Humfrey tell vs that the foreſaid paſſage was razed in a latin Epiſtle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript of Bennitts Colledge in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brige yet there to be ſeene. And wheras the author of the publication ſaith that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes razed ar to be reſtored by twoe other Epiſtles of the ſame Alfric in latin extant in the librarie of Exceter, contrarily D.

Beſydes this the ſame Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes out of Fox ſaith the Epiſtle which he affirmes to haue ben thus mangled and torne was to wulfſtan Archbiſhop of yorke and hath for title, <hi>de conſuetudine Monacho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:</hi> wheras yet the foreſaid publiſher of Alfrics new founde writings, intileth that

Which iarres I confeſſe I am ſoe vnable to compoſe that I can not but vehemently ſuſpect theſe mens repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to be falſe and counterfet. Eſpecially conſidering that Iames affirmes the latin Epiſtle ſoe razed as they reporte, to haue ben directed by Alfric to that wulſtan whoe was Archbiſhop of yorke aboute the yeare 954. wher as yet the author of the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet in which theſe writings ar contained, in his prefate to the ſame, ſaith that this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric to whome he attributes them was equall to Alfric Archbiſhop of Canterburie which he alſoe affirmes to haue ben in that ſeat ſix yeares before that wulſtan to whome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric's Epiſtle was writen, was Archbiſhop of yoke: ſoe that the one reportes this Epiſtle to haue ben wriren to the firſt wulſtan and the other to the ſecond not obſtanding all hiſtories and Cathologues of Biſhops (among which is Godwins) doe teſtifye ſoe long a ſpace of tyme to haue paſſed betweixt their ſtandings, as it is from the yeare 955. and 1003. ſoe that theſe twoe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators drawe back warde and fore ward like twoe ill match aſſes.</p>
                  <p>More ouer the foreſaid publiſher will
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:2119:271"/> needs haue Alfric the ſuppoſed author the homilie and epiſtles to haue ben a diſtinct man from that Alfric whoe was Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Canterburie wheras neuerſheleſſe Iohn Leland whoe profeſſedly writ of the writers of England relating the ſeuerall workes of Alfric the Archbiſhop of Canterburie maketh noe mention of anie other writers of that name but of him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither doth he put anie epiſtle among his writings but onely one intituled, <hi>de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudine Monachorum,</hi> of the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of monkes, which ſubiect how farre it diſagreth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preſence of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the Euchariſt, and tranſſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I leaue to the iudgement of the reader to conſider.</p>
                  <p>In fine to conclude my whole diſcourſe touching this matter I ſay firſt, that if it were true as our aduerſaries pretend that in the foreſaid writings ther weere anie thing contained contrarie to the reall preſence and tranſſubſtantiation, yet haue I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by inſoluable reaſons that neither Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric could be the author of them, neither could anie ſuch doctrine haue ben publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained in the Church of England in or aboute his dayes. But what ſoeuer do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was then publiſhed and tought in our countrie was canformable in all points with
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:2119:271"/> the doctrine and faith then profeſſed in the Church of Rome with which the Engliſh Church and her Paſtors had correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and ſubordination as I haue manifeſtly declared. Secondly Althou I am not able to iudge determinately whoe might be author of thoſe writings becauſe I haue noe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to come to the view of them otherwiſe then in that patched and mangled manner in which they are publiſhed by our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: neuertheleſſe I perſuade my ſelfe they were writ by ſome Romane catholique author, ſoe that taken in their innocencie and prime puritie and piouſly interpreted they containe no vnſounde or erroneous doctrine, but rather expreſſe teſtimonie and proofes of diuers points controuerſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the nouelliſts of theſe our tymes and catholike Romaniſts. As appeareth in the mention they make of <hi>maſſe, miracles, the ſigne of the Croſſe,</hi> and other particulars which I haue noted in my cenſure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. the iudicious reader may eaſily perſuade him ſelf that ſuppoſing theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings according to the relation of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, haue remained in publike places and libraries for the ſpace of aboue 600. yeares, if they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained anie doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to that faith of the Euchariſt which I haue hiſtorically demonſtrated aboue to
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:2119:272"/> haue ben profeſſed in our countrie of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland euer ſince, and before, that tyme: its more then morally euident they would haue receiued long a fore this tyme repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, or cenſure according to their deſert.</p>
                  <p>Finally. Suppoſing it were true that the foreſaid writings did in deed containe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contrarie to the reall preſence, and tranſſubſtantiation as they ar beleeued and defended by the profeſſors of the Roman Religion wheras yet they doe not ſoe, but onely exclude the carnal, palpaple or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharnaitical preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, and inſtruct the people in the inuiſible preſence of his bodie, and bloude in the Sacrament in an obuius and eaſie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner: yet in reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought not anie iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Catholique to alter his faith of the ſame for anie argument which can be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne or deduced from ſuch teſtimonie as is voyde of other credit then is to be giuen to aduerſaries in fauor of their owne cauſe which is iuſt none at all, eſpecially they being no other then theſe whoe not onely in this particular, but alſoe in other matters of controuerſie haue vſed much partialitie, &amp; deceipt as in an other place I haue demonſtrated out of their ſeuerall
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:2119:272"/> workes. And in particular the publiſher of the ſame pamphlet in which the homilie &amp; Epiſtles of which I heare treate, are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, beſides diuers vntruthes which he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth as well touching the author and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of his writing, as alſoe his titles and marginall notes, and likewiſe in that he couningly and couſeningly publiſheth in the ſame volume a treatiſe of the ould, and new teſtament in the name of Alfric as if it included a different canon of ſcripture to that which is now vſed in the Roman Church, and agreeable to their now En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Bible: which is yet moſt apparently falſe for that (as I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber) it putteth in the number and order of the Canonicall boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes Eccleſiaſticus, Sapience, Tobie, Iudith and the Machabeis, which yet our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries reiect for Apocryphal: As alſoe in that more ouer the ſame Pampheter addeth a teſtimonie to ſhewe that in tymes paſt the lords prayer, the creed and the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements were extant and vſed in the vulgar tongue; a worke moſt imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently performed by him, and as it ſeemes onely or cheefely to enlarge the bulke and price of his pamphlet: it being certaine that the Romaniſts neuer neither held that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnlawfull, or at this preſent prohibit the
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:2119:273"/> vſe of the vulgar language for the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements and priuate prayer of the common people but rather the contrarie as both their Catechiſmes and their daylie practiſe moſt plainely witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>By all which particulars and the reſt of this my aduertiſſement it is euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the glorious which the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelliſts of our countrie make by their publication of the homilie epiſtles and o- writings in the name of Alfric, be no other then certaine preſtigious impoſtures to perſuade the ſimple ſorte of people by the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe falſe floriſhes, that their denyall of the reall preſence of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, and tranſſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not quite voyde of antiquitie, but hath ben preached and profeſſed in our countrie before the dayes of luther. And now let this ſuffice to repulſe this fictitious and deceitefull calumniation of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries touching theſe putatiue wrings of Alfric by the publication of which and the like counterfeit wares they pick ſimple peoples purſes whoe take all for as true as gaſpell that is put in print by anie of their owne brothers.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond aduertiſſement I giue to the reader is that wheras the kinght page 205. of his fafe wais cites Agobard for a denyer of
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:2119:273"/> honor of image in his booke of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Agobardus Epiſc. Lugdun. li. de pict. &amp; imag.</hi>
                     </note> I haue dilgently peruſed the ſame, and finde that in deed this author ſpeaketh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re harſhely of this matter then anie other catholique writer of theſe dayes how be it this was the age in which images had their greateſt enimies. Neuertheleſſe it is moſt certaine this author onely confutes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of diuine honor and the like, vnto images, as is ſacrifice, or confidence in them or prayer vnto them: reprehending the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of ſome particular perſons whoe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſely adored them, for ſoe he diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a boute the end of his booke ſaying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But none of the ancient Catholiques did euer thinke them to be worshiped or adored: yet now the error by increaſe is become ſoe perſpicuous that it is neare, or like to the hereſie of the Antropomorphits to adore figments and to put hope in them, and that by reaſon of this error faith being remoued from the harte, all our confidence be placed in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things.</hi> And a little after. <hi>Soe alſoe if we ſee penned or fethered Angels painted, the Apostles preaching, martyres ſuffering torments, we muſt not expect anie helpe from the pictures which we behould, becauſe they can neither doe good nor ill: rightly therfore</hi> (theſe are the wordes cited by the kinght) <hi>to euacuate ſuch ſuperstition it was defined by orthodox Fathers that pictures should not be made in churches leaſt that which
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:2119:274"/> si worshiped and adored be painted in the walles</hi> which wordes being not his owne but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of a fragment of the Prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all councell of Eliberis in Spaine and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ioyned them imediately to his owne in which he onely treates of diuine honor as not due to images, it is cleare and euident he intendes to proue nothing elſe by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie then that which he there propoſeth. To omit that this paſſage of the Eliberitan cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell was deliuered in a ſenſe much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from this in which Agobardus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrueth it, as I haue conuinced in others pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and occaſions.</p>
                  <p>And that this author intendes to teache nothing elſe, but onely that images muſt not be honored with worſhip due to God, the ſeuerall teſtimonies which he largely produceth out of S. Auguſtin, S. Hierome, &amp; other ancient writers doe manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, not one of which can be taken (if they be truely vnderſtanded) in anie other ſenſe, as clearely may appeare to the diligent reader of their wordes, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely exclude onely honor of Sacrifice, prayers directed vnto the images them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, or religion proper to God onely, in the worſhip of ſaincts, and their pictures: and alſoe Agobardus him ſelf vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the places which he citeth doth auerre,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:2119:274"/> plainely declaring that he graunteth ſome ſorte of honor to images wher thus he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let vs behould the picture as a picture deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of life, ſenſe, and reaſon: let the eye be fed with this viſion, but let the mynde reuerence God whoe both giues to his ſaints a crowne of victorie, and to vs the aſſistance of their interceſſion.</hi> And the like he affirmes of honor of ſaincts a little aboue in this ſame page. Wher althou' he iuſtely reſerueth the ſupreame worſhip of Sacrifice to God a lone, yet he expreſſely grauntes an other inferior honor to Saints and Angels ſaying. <hi>Adoretur, colatur, venere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur a fidelibus Deus, &amp;c. Let God be adored, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped,</hi> or ſerued, <hi>and reuerenced by faithfull people, let Sacrifice be offered to him a lone, either in the myſterie of his bodie and bloud, or in the Sacrifice of a contrite and humble harte, let Angels or holye men be loued, honored, with charitie, not with ſeruitude, let not Chriſts bodie be offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</hi> And according to this ſenſe Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardus ſpeakes throu' his whole booke, particularly in his ſecond leafe wher he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth certaine idolaters whoe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a certaine ſanctitie to reſide in images ſaying. <hi>In which nature theſe alſoe whoe call images holye, are founde not onely Sacrilegious for that they giue diuine worship to the workes of their handes, but alſoe foolish in attributing ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:2119:275"/> to images which haue no life or ſoule.</hi> By all which wordes it is cleare that Agobarde onely condemnes the exhibition of ſuch honor to ſaincts, or images as is due to God a lone. Which doctrine is ſoe farre from being anie way contrarie to the honor of images practiſed in the Roman Church that it doth rather exactely agree with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Councell of Trent in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which in the 25. Seſſion defines that, <hi>due honor is to be giuen to images not becauſe it should be beleeued that ther is anie diuinitie or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in them for which they ar to be worshiped, or that anie thing should be craued of them, or that confidence or hope should be put in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in tymes past the Gentiles did, whoe placed their hope in Idols, but becauſe the honor which is exhibited vnto them is referred to the prototypes or perſons which they repreſent. ſoe that by the images which we ſalute or kiſſe, and before which we vncouer our head, and proſtrate our ſelues, we adore and reuerence Christ, and the ſaints whoſe repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or ſimiletudes they beare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>True it is, I haue noted in reading his booke that Agobard purpoſely refuſeth to vſe theſe wordes <hi>adorare, colere, adore,</hi> or <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue:</hi> yet I plainely gather by his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he doth not ſoe to ſignifye ther by that images ar not to be vſed with anie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor at all, as I haue alreadie declared by his
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:2119:275"/> owne text: but onely declineth the vſe of thoſe wordes in regarde he takes them in a ſtrict ſenſe, as they ſignifie religion or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor proper to God him ſelf, and not due to anie creature: and perhaps alſoe becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe at that tyme as it may ſeeme by his nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſome others of that age, the worde adoration was offenſiue euen to ſome whoe otherwiſe were both Catholique, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men: to ſay nothing of the common people ſome of whome peraduentute out of ignorance, and weakenes of iudgement, euen at this day make danger to vſe it, and ſcruple to heare it: yet neither the one nor the other omitting to honore images ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the approbation, and practiſe of the Church. Wheras yet if it be taken in the ſenſe in which the Roman Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the definition of the 7. Synod and cuſtome of diuines, accepteth it, that is for a kynde of inferior honor diſtinct from proper latrie and religion, and as (euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vſe of ſcriptures) it ſignifyes worſhip common alſoe to creatures, then doth it include no manner of ſcandall or offenſe at all. <note place="margin">

<pb n="552" facs="tcp:2119:276"/> he intendeth onely to proue that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ar not to be adored or ſerued: in which paſſage he proueth nothing againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholique honor of images, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſputeth either againſt ſome reliquies of the Antropomorphitan hereſie: or againſt ſome other ſuperſtitious, and idolatrous adorers of Saints &amp; images of thoſe dayes, from both which kyndes of errors as Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardus him ſelf was, ſoe alſoe the Roman Church with her cheefe Paſtors and rulers (to which he then was a ſubordinate mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and prelate as other of his workes doe witneſſe) were free and innocent as likewi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe now they be in this our preſent age not obſtanding the frequent calumniations of our moderne ſectaries to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
                  <p>Finally I adde to this that in the verie concluſion, and laſt period of his booke, Agobard expreſſely teacheth that genufle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to be made to the name of Ieſus, which yet our Puritan aduerſaries out of their ſingular puritie, or rather pure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie, reiect as idolatrous, not obſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by Gods commaundement, not onely men but deuils alſoe ar enioyned, and compelled to bowe their knees at the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of that ſoueraine name. And ſurely he who holdes this for lawfull, as Agobardus
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:2119:276"/> doth, muſt for the ſame reaſons hold it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe lawfull to honor the images of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſuppoſing that the name of Ieſus being to be honored onely for the repreſentation it hath of him, much more lawfully may his image be ſoe honored in regarde it doth more permanently and ferfectly repreſent him then doth his name which conſiſts in carracters, and a tranſitorie ſounde of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Beſides this, Agobardus as the verie firſt wordes of his booke doe declare, doth not directly and profeſſedly treate in it of the honor and vſe of images as it is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the church, but of the ſenſe of the firſt commaundement, in which he includes the prohibition of the adoration of images deliuered by God in the old Teſtament as a parte of the ſame, onely intending to proue in his whole worke that by virtue of this precept, diuine honor is not to be tendered to anie creature but to God alone, &amp; not to either idoles or images.</p>
                  <p>And Therfore in his laſte page the ſame Agobardus expreſſely ſpeaketh of honor proper to God him ſelf, applying to his purpoſe the wordes of Iſaias <hi>honorem meum alteri non dabo.</hi> by all which it is moſt cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparent that what ſoeuer Agobarde ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to vtter againſt the adoration of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is onely ſpoken againſt ſuch as attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:2119:277"/> ouer much honor vnto them worſhip the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in an idolatrous, or ſuperſtitious faſhion contrarie to the tradition of Fathers and practiſe of the Catholique Church as his wordes quoted in my margen ſufficiently declare.<note place="margin">

                     </note> And ſoe I leaue him as no enimie to the Catholique cauſe, nor anie fauorer of the diſalawers of the ſame in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular point, how be it the ambiguitie of his ſpeech may giue occaſion of error to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or ill affected readers.</p>
                  <p>To this I ioyne my reſponſion to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wordes cyted by our aduerſarie in the ſame place &amp; out of the ſame booke of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobardus as I ſuppoſe, for he ioynes them to the reſt of thoſe which ther he had. to wit theſe which followe. <hi>Ther is nos example in all the ſcriptures, or Fathers for adoration of images. They ought to be taken for an ornament to pleaſe the ſight, not to inſtruct the people.</hi> To which I anſwer <hi>in primis,</hi> touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parte of the ſentence, Agobardus hath no ſuch expreſſe wordes as thoſe; he onely ſaying thus: <hi>the ancients alſoe had the images of ſaint painted, or graued: but for rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance not to worship them:</hi> which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ar ſoma't different from thoſe other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed by ſir Hum. neuertheleſſe becauſe they ſeeme to include a denyal of honor of images, I reſponde ſecondly. Agobard ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:2119:277"/> the wordes <hi>colere &amp; adorare</hi> which ther he vſeth, in the ſame se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe in which he vſeth them in the reſt of his booke; that is for diuine honor as I haue aboue declared by ſeueral paſſages of the ſame. According to which acception his wordes ar verie true, nor anie way repugnant to the doctrine of the Roman Church either in thoſe dayes, or at this preſent tyme, which as in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, ſoe in this in which we liue doth zealouſly deteſt, and abhorre as plainely idolatrous all diuine adoration of creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, tho' neuer ſo eminent either in nature, or grace. Thirdly to the latter parte of the ſame ſentence, I ſay confidently, I am ſure ther ar no ſuch wordes in Agobardes boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke euen as it is publiſhed and printed at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris by Papyrius Maſſon him ſelfe, out of whoſe Bibliotheke be it good, or bad, ſir Humfrey produceth it: ſoe that I doe not vnderſtand this iugling for other then plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne forgerie, or falſification.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, thoſe laſte wordes. <hi>They</hi> (images) <hi>ought to be taken for an ornament to pleaſe the ſight, not to inſtruct the people:</hi> ar iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte contrarie to the doctrine of S. Gregorie teaching expreſſely that pictures ar the bookes of the illiterate, and ſimple people. Which doctrine of S. Gregorie, Agobarde was neither ſoe ignorant as not to knowe
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:2119:278"/> it, nor yet ſoe impudent as to denye it.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, thoſe ſame wordes manifeſtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagree to the reſt of Agobardes owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as his wordes by me related ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare, partucularly thoſe: <hi>Habue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt namque &amp; antequi magiues ſanctorum ad recordandum &amp;c.</hi> Laſtely, Sir Humfrey muſt knowe that Papyrius Maſſon is regiſtred by the authors of our expurgatore Index, and conſequently, he is no current Romaniſt, and much leſſe is he anie of our beſt learned men as neither was Agobardus which ar yet thoſe whome he profeſſeth in the title of his booke to alledge againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>And ſoe by this, Agobarde is abſolutely cleared from all imputation of iconoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie or error againſt images, and the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our aduerſarie conuinced to be voyde of force.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore touching that which the knight alledgeth out of Hincmar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the decree of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cfort a boute images, he deliuered it onely as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, &amp; being young in yeares &amp; vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced he miſtooke the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſaid ſynod for the ſchiſmaticall determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a priuate Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenticle, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ben in the ſame place &amp; at the ſame ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, or preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly after the diſſolution of the councell, he might eaſily take the one for
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:2119:278"/> the other. In which hiſtoricall paſſage, as ſome authors opinate, by the credit he gaue to the ſuppoſed Carolin bookes, he both er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe, &amp; gaue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of error to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whoe relying vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his reporte haue put the ſame in their generall hiſtories publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſince his tyme: yet this being onely a priuate error of fact and that vncertaine it was without anie preiudice to the faith and practiſe of Catholique Church</p>
                  <p>Beſides it appeares euidently by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of 55. chapters which the ſame Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare Archbiſhop of Rhemes writ to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie Hincmare Biſhop of laon, he was a verie pious &amp; Cotholi<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> prelate &amp; an acko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledger of the Popes ſupremacie ouer the reſt of the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Churches Greek &amp; Latin, for ſoe he ſpeakes in Hic fift chapter of that worke. <hi>qui in illius</hi> (Sedis Apoſtolicae) <hi>primata beatus Petrus cunctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oucra portat, cuius princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patus authoritate mediator Dei &amp; hominum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Chriſtus Ieſus ſedem Romanam ſuper omnes ſedos ſublimauit, Alexandrinam decorauit, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinam confirmauit</hi> &amp;c. wherfore it is improbable that Hnicmare who ſpeaketh ſoe honorably of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, ſhould at the ſame tyme haue vttered anie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſoe contrarie to the then receiued practiſe of the ſame, as is contained in thoſe wordes viz. Images ar to be taken for an
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:2119:279"/> ornament to pleaſe the ſight not to inſtruct the people.</p>
                  <p>To this I adde for confirmation of my anſer, it is not credible to imagine that ther hauing paſſed diuers letters betwixt Pope Adrian (in whoſe tyme due honor of images was defined againſt the oppoſers of it) and other Popes of thoſe tymes, and this Hincmare, for compoſing the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie betweene him and Biſhop Hincmare of Laon, as alſoe aboute other matters; it is not credible I ſay thoſe Popes ſhould not once haue reprehended and condemned him for this poſition, if truely he had ben a maintainer of it Beſides the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories doe teſtifye that aboute the ſame tyme, this ſame Hincmar at the perſuaſion of Pope Nicolas confuted the criminations of the Grecians againſt the Roman Church, of whome he would neuer haue made choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe for ſuch a buſines, if he had ben either knowne or ſuſpected to haue defended anie doctrine repugnant to the vſe and honor of images eſtabliſhed in the 7. Synod and then commonly practiſed in the Chriſtian world.</p>
                  <p>And thus we ſee that nothing produced by our aduerſarie out of this author repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth to the doctrine of that moderate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of images which hath ben vniuerſally
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:2119:279"/> profeſſed in the Roman Church both in the tyme of Agobarde and in this preſent age.</p>
                  <p>My third aduertiſſement is that the knight in the 289. page of his ſafe way iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly accuſeth Charon for a blaſphemer of ſcriptures alledgeing him to affirme they ar imperfect, obſcure, doubtfull, ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, perplexed. And yet I finde that this author in his thrid booke <hi>de tribus veritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> (which is the ſame our aduerſarie cites althou' not in the ſame language) page 97. 98. and the reſt imediately following in his french edition (for I could not haue him in latin) expreſſely cleares him ſelfe and Roman church of that foule and odious calumniation feigned by Pleſſis in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. Charons wordes ar theſe. <hi>Venons an particularitez qu'ils nous font dire, encore qu'ils les propoſent mal, &amp; autrement que nous ne le diſons, pour nous rendre odieux: premierement que nous le diſons l'eſcriture eſte imperfecte: an contraire nous la croyons, confeſſons &amp; preſchons, perfecte, pleine, entiere, tres-ſuffiſante come estant oeuure de Dieu, du quel ne ſorte rien qui ne ſoit tel. Parquoy tout ce que Du Pleſſis dict, ſcauoir eſt qu'elle est perfecte, ſuffiſante, a ſalut que IESV ſon autheur eſt la perfection, c'ſt en vain. car cela a este enſeigne par nous deuan luy: &amp; ne fut iamais dict par les Catholiques choſe au contraire. quant
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:2119:280"/> a l'obſcurité, doubte, ambiguite, nous n'en parlons pas de tout ſi cruement, mais nous diſons bien franc hement deux choſes, &amp; l'auons aſſes dict &amp; monſtré cy deſſus, que l'ſcriture est fort difficile a entendre: qu'elle eſt priſé &amp; employee de touts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differemment bons &amp; mauuais en caution &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe de toutes opinions, &amp; a la ruine de pluſieurs.</hi> Thes ar Charons expreſſe wordes which I engliſh in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. <hi>Let vs come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, wich they make vs ſpeake althou' they propoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrong, and otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we vtter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make vs odious: firſt that we ſaye the ſcriptures ar im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: on the contrarie wee beleeue, confeſſe, and preache them to be perfect, compleat and entire, ſufficient, as being the worke of God, from who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me nothing proceeds which is not ſuch, for which cauſe al that which Pleſſis ſaith viz. that the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is peafect, ſufficient to ſaluation, that Ieſus the author of it, is perfection it ſelfe, is in vaine. For that hath ben taught by vs before him: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was anie thing to the contrarie euer ſpoken by the Catholiques. For as much as concernes, obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, doubtfulnes, ambiguitie, we doe not ſpae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke altogither ſoe crudely or rawly, yet we ſay freely twoe things of which we haue ſufficiently ſaid, and demonſtrated them before, that the ſcripture is verie hard or difficult to vnderſtand: that it is taken and applyed by euerie one indifferently good and bad in caution and defence of all apinions, and to the ruine of manie.</hi>

                  <p>This is that I finde in this author to this purpoſe, which how repugnant it is to our aduerſaries purpoſe the reader can not be ignorant except he be affectedly ignorant as the knight ſeemes to be euen in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, onely this excuſe I conceiue he may haue, if it be as I perſuade my ſelfe, to wit that truſting to that pitt of corruption Pleſſis, he deliuered this paſſage to vs by retaile as he receiued it from him which if he did I ſhall not beſorie, for that I deſire not to charge my oppoſites more then I muſt of neceſſitie: neither is ther anie need of amplification in that nature, where the matter is ſoe copious, and aboundante.</p>

                  <p>It is true I muſt confeſſe this author, in his firſt Action of this worke, hath broached an extrauagant opinion touching the wordes of conſecration, for which cauſe principally as I ſuppoſe the expurgatorie Index prohibiteth his booke till it be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. for in his 264. and 265. pages he endeuoreth to proue that preiſts doe not conſecrate by virtue of thoſe wordes <hi>hoc est corpus meum:</hi> but by virtue of thoſe, <hi>hoc face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te in meam commemerationem.</hi> In confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which his opinion althou' he diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in an vnaccuſtomed manner among deuines both ancient and moderne, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

                  <p>And now I hence inferre as a thing more directly for my purpoſe that the wordes which Sir Humfrey produceth againſt tranſſubſtantiation out of a certaine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe intuled de Correctione Theologiae Scholaſticae, are not truely the wordes of this author; But that Treatiſe is falſely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed vnto him and forged in his name how ſoeuer our aduerſaries make great eſtimation and vſe of it: That which I clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely demonſtrate becauſe it containeth doctrine repugnant to that which he him ſelfe teacheth in his owne vndoubded wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke againſt the Sacramentaries. For wheras according to the citation of the knight in his 108. page of his ſafe way, in his Treatiſe inſcribed de correct. Theol. Schol. Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus hath theſe wordes: Therfore it moſt certaine that Chriſt did not conſecrate by thoſe wordes (this is my bodie) neither ar they anie parte of conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet in his Treatiſe againſt the Sacramentaries he directly affirmeth the contrarie ſaying thus <hi>Christus enim horum verborum (hoc eſt corpus
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:2119:284"/> meum) vi &amp; operatione conſecrationem confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit: panis natura in verum ipſius corpus ſeſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tante &amp;c.</hi> Which is in Engliſh. Chriſt did conſecrate by virtue and operation of the wordes (this is my bodie) the nature of the bread being changed or changeing it ſelfe in to his bodie &amp;c. Now it is plane that theſe wordes plainely contradict the other rehearſed by our aduerſarie, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe directly and expreſſely affirming that Chriſt did conſecrate by theſe wordes (this is my bodie) the other directely and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely denying the ſame. In ſoe much ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt of neceſſitie grante that the Archbiſhop plainely contradicted him ſelfe, which is not to be admitted eſpecially in a graue &amp; learned diuine as he was: or elſe that the Treatiſe in which is ſoe expreſſely contained a denyall of that ſame which the ſame author affirmeth in his owne knowne &amp; acknowledged worke, is not truely his, but falſifyed and falſely published in his name. and conſequently what ſoeuer our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie produceth out of it proueth nothing, but is to be regiſtred in the liſt of ſuch other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit wares as he ſelleth to his reader for curre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the reſt of his worke. And touching his Treatiſe againſt the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me other of his workes althou' they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſome extrauagant poſitions and therfore
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:2119:284"/> were iuſtely condemned to be expurged by the authors of the Index, yet becauſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in his booke againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyers of the reall preſence, the author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prſſely ſubmitteth his doctrine to the cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the Roman Church purpoſely place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the frontiſpice of his booke, <hi>omnia ſanctae Ecceſiae Catholicae ac ſanctae ſedi Apoſtolicae Romanae iudicio ſubmiſſa ſancto,</hi> therfore his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie can not anie way preiudice the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man faith. And now let this ſuffice to shewe the falſitie of this citation: onely the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt further ſuppoſe that if I had ſeene the Treatiſe it ſelfe I could haue cleared the matter more exactely: But our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries take an order for that keeping cloſſe all ſuch obſcure workes and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them for their owne pallates as great nouelties and moſt daintie diſhes.</p>
                  <p>Some fewe more authors remaine vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by reaſon I could not haue them: as Cardinal Carapha. Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes Marius, &amp; twoe or three others. But I aſſure the reader the allegations drawne out of them by my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie containe no matter of importance which is not ſufficiently cleared without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie further ſearche of the places as they ſtand in the bookes. Onely this inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience ther is in this matter viz. That if I had obtained a ſight of the authors the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,

                  <head>THE INTRODVCTION TO THE APPENDIX.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y that tyme I had in a manner finished my cenſure of knight Humfreyes nicnamed falſe way, I receaued ſodaine newes of another way, eyther of the ſame author or of his frend for him, which like a ſecond parte of the Pickro came ruflling out with a greater noyſe then the firſt: &amp; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is as I ſuppoſe as well for that it carrieth a more extrauagant title to wit <hi>via deuia,</hi> as alſo in regard it is ſome what larger both inleaues, &amp; as I thinke in lyes.</p>
                  <p>Why the author should call his firſte booke <hi>via tnta</hi> or the ſafe way, &amp; this <hi>via deuia</hi> or the by way rather then the contrarie, in my conceit few will be able to imagine anie other reaſon then his owne knightlie pleaſure: &amp;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2119:288"/> for my part I muſt needes confeſſe that his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ſeuerallie applied to the contents are to me meere riddles, as not conteyning eyther expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citlie or implicitlie that which they make showe of, but rather ſtanding onelie for cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers or markes of the authors affected follie promiſing much but performing nothing, as I haue made appeere in part by myne anſere to his firſt worke, &amp; partlie alſo shall be showed by Gods aſſiſtance in this againſt which I now write; of which altho' I doe not intend to make anie fotmall confutation in euerie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular point of doctrine as I did before, more then once repenting my ſelfe that I ſpent ſo much time vpon ſuch idle matter: yet will I make a breife ſuruey of euery diſtinct ſection principallie noting &amp; notifieing to the reader ſuch faultes as I shall finde the author guiltie of, whome I alſo aduertiſe that notobſtanding the knight with theſe his two bookes as it were with the deliuerie of two prodigious twinnes, would ſeeme to haue brought forth ſome great &amp; ſtrange noueltie to the world: yet in veritie there is nothing of moment allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him eyther in this or in his former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, eyther out of ſcriptures, Councells, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which hath not binne long ſince exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; confuted by a greater &amp; farre more learned number of Catholike diuines then all the pretenſiue reformed Churches can affoord
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2119:288"/> as appoſers of the Roman doctrine. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' I doe ingenuouſlie confeſſe that Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey hath vſed no ſmale art &amp; induſtrie in the application of his predeceſſours labours to his owne intent &amp; purpoſe; neuertheleſſe he hath performed the ſame in ſuch a couſening &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull manner, that the reader may aſſure himſelfe t'is almoſt one &amp; the ſame labour to diſcouer his lyes, equiuocations, falſe ſuppoſitions, impertinent &amp; corrupted allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; other his inſincere dealing, &amp; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute his doctrine, it being little more then a maſſe or compound of thoſe &amp; the like cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted &amp; vitious ingredients, nor contayning anie graue or ſolid diſcuſſion of anie one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion <hi>in terminis</hi> or profeſſedlie, but onelie or cheiflie conſiſting in a certaine abſtractiue way by compacting patches &amp; shreads of furtiue &amp; ſtollen diuinitie deliuered in a plauſible &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſiue manner: of which altho' I doe not denie but the author hath receiued great parte at the ſecond hand from his anteceſſors, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie from his great Patron Daniel Chamier who in the art of cheating doth in my opinion eyther exceed or at the leaſt equalize anie that euer writ before him; in regard of which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the knight might ſeeme in ſome ſort excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable at the leaſt by ignorance: yet hath he or his chaplins inuented &amp; added ſo much in that nature of his owne coyning, that I doe not ſee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2119:289"/> what coulourable excuſe can poſſiblie be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged for iuſtification of his bad proceedings. And when reading of Bellarmines bookes of controuerſies I found ſo manie vntruthes, falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, &amp; corruptions, by him diſcouered out of Luther, Caluin, Beza, Brentius, Kemnitius, &amp; other ſectaries who had writ before him, I imagined that, at leaſt, for, verie shame their ſucceſſors as being ſuch great profeſſors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation would haue reformed themſelues in that kinde; but now of late ſince I came to read the workes of Daniel Chamier &amp; Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey Lind, I profeſſe I haue quite loſt my hope of their reclamation, eſpeciallie reflecting that as they are all men of one profeſſion, &amp; haue all of them an ill cauſe to maintaine, ſo are they all fallen into a fatall neceſſitie of abuſing their readers with trickes &amp; ſleights: the reaſon of which is plaine, in regard that falſehood as being of a contrarie nature to truth it cannot poſſibly be defended &amp; patronized by the ſame truth, but muſt of neceſſitie be defended by it ſelfe. And as for Sir Humfrey he is ſo deepelie plundged in that muddie ditch, that he &amp; his honour are like to lye there for euer, his ill cuſtome being now almoſt turned into nature, &amp; as proper to him as blacke is to an Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian, or white to a ſwanne.</p>
                  <p>And to proceed to particulars, he is ſo voyde of shame that he doubtes not to abuſe Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2119:289"/> in the very fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiſpice of his booke, where for poſye or ſentence of the ſame, he putteth certaine words of his taken out of his firſt booke <hi>de verbo Dei cap.</hi> 2. intending by this indirect meanes to perſwade his readers that the contents of his whole worke haue that famous Cardinall for their patron &amp; approuer, which in my iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is a point of the greateſt couſenage &amp; impudency that euer was heard of among Chriſtian writers; ſince that neither that which Bellarmines words import containe the whole, or yet the cheife drife of Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys booke, neither are they vttered by him in that ſenſe in which he doth apply them, to wit that the ſcriptures are the ſole rule of faith, &amp; that there is no other rule but onely them: wher as Bellarmin onely affirmeth that the ſcriptures are a moſt certaine &amp; a moſt ſafe rule in caſe they be rightly interpreted &amp; according to the ancient tradition of the Church, <note place="margin">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2119:290"/> himſelfe touching the totallity &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallity of the rule of faith, where yet nothing is to be found in that ſenſe which the knight fraudulently framed to his owne purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And now from hence I paſſe to the Epiſtle dedicatory, on which I had ſcarce caſt myne eyes, when preſently I diſcouered two or three ſlanderous lyes vttered by the author: the firſte is, that the pretended Catholike Church as he phraſeth her, is made the whole rule of faith by the Romaniſts: the ſecond, that the Romane Catholikes are tought to eate their God &amp; kill their King: the third that the Pope at this day alloweth of the Iewes Talmud &amp; inhibiteth the bookes of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. And thoſe vntruthes I haue noted onely, not for that I could not haue marked out others, but becauſe they ſeemed the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious groſſe &amp; palpable. I omit alſo to ſpecify diuers places of Bellarmine cited by Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey both heere &amp; in many other partes of his worke, which well examined can ſerue him for no other purpoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to coulore his couſinage.</p>
                  <p>And as for the reſt of his preface, I can aſſure the reader, it is little more then an idle &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious repetition of the ſame matters which he handled in his firſte booke: and whoſoeuer will take the paines to read both his pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets will find ſo frequent reherſall of the ſame things that his eares will tingle to heere them: nay ſome whole chapters of this booke there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2119:290"/> bee, which excepting the title haue little other matter then the ſame which is found in the other, as will appeere in particular to him who shall conferre the two laſt ſections of it with the tenth &amp; eleuenth ſections of the ſafe way; In ſo much that I thinke I may not vnfitly ſay of the workes of Sir Humfrey that which a certaine pleaſant wit ſayd once of the writings of Luther, <hi>Tolle contradictiones, calumnias, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacia, dicteria, ac ſchommata ſcurillia in Catholicos Romanos, inanes digreſsiones, ambages, atque inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles verborum multiplicationes, &amp; duo eius vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumina in vnum haud magnum libellulum redigi poſse non dubito:</hi> that is, take way Sir Humfreys contradictions, calumniations, &amp; lyes, take away his ſcoffes, &amp; ieaſtes againſt the Romane Catholikes, his idle &amp; vaine digreſſions, &amp; multiplication of wordes, or repetition of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with his friuolous circumlocutions, &amp; I doe not doubt but both his volumes may be eaſily reduced to the bulke of one ſmall pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.

                     <note place="margin">Sec. 1.</note> In his firſt ſection, I thinke I may trulie ſay Sir Humfrey telleth but one vntruth, but it is ſo lardge a lye that it reaches from end to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2119:291"/> end, I meane but one totall lye, for partiall lyes there are diuers. This totall vntruth is in that he affirmeth in his ſecond page, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt vs &amp; them, is ſuch as was betwixt S. Auguſtine &amp; the Donatiſts, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly conuinced to be falſe euen by thoſe ſame words which he himſelf cites out of that holy doctor, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug. de vnit.

And yet the queſtion is not betwixt the Romaniſts &amp; the Reformers where the true Church is, but which is the true Church? that is, whether the Romane church &amp; all the reſt of the particular Churches in the world adhering to &amp; obeying that Church as the cheife &amp; mother Church be that true Catholike Church mentioned in the Creed &amp; commended in the ſcriptures, or the reformed Church or Churches whereſoeuer they be: which the reader may plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue to be a farre different queſtion, from that of which S. Auguſtine ſpeaketh in the place cited by the kinght. Secondly the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this ſection runneth vpon a falſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to witt that the Romaniſts refuſe to proue the truth of their Church by ſcriptures onelie, as S. Auguſtine did, ſaith the kinght, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the donatiſts; but this is not true, for the Romaniſts are ſo farre for reprouing that cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in this point, that they ſcarce vſe any other
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2119:291"/> proofes then thoſe ſame ſcriptures which the ſame S. Auguſtin ordinarily vſeth for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as may be ſeene in the workes of both ancient &amp; moderne diuines.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly neuertheles when the Romaniſts ſay they proue the truth of their Church by ſcriptures onely, they doe not therfore meane ſo that they exclude the interpretation of them according to the ancient tradition of the ſame Catholike Church; for ſo neither S. Auguſtine eyther againſt the Donatiſts or any other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks in the like caſe, alleaged the ſcriptures, but as the ſame Saint Auguſtine ſaith thou' partly in different wordes &amp; to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>De vnit. Eccleſ. c.</hi> 19.</note> 
                     <hi>vt non niſi verum ſenſum &amp; Catholicum teneamus,</hi> not ſo but that we doe followe the true &amp; Catholike ſenſe of the ſame ſcriptures. And in fewe wordes that which the Romaniſts meane is, that they doe not vſe the ſcriptures for proofe of their Church in the ſenſe of the pretenſiue reformed Churches, but ouerly in that ſenſe which anciently hath binne imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the moſt vniuerſally floryshing Church in all or moſt ages according to the diuerſity of tymes.</p>
                  <p>And thus we ſee cleerlie that Sir Humfrey in diuerſe reſpects hath groſſelie &amp; ignorantlie miſtaken the ſtate of the queſtion both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt S. Auguſtine &amp; the Donatiſts, &amp; alſo betwixt himſelfe &amp; the Romaniſts. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2119:292"/> thoſe authorities which he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth eyther out of S. Auguſtine or other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers are impertinent &amp; of no force againſt the faith of the Romane Church: but on the contrarie by his falſe dealing he hath fallen into that by path which in his erroneous imagination he hath prepared for his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; in which neuertheleſſe he himſelfe if he proceed in this manner is like to walke euen to the end of his iorney, I meane throu' all the ſections of his booke.</p>

Let the indifferent reader be Iudge of this.</p>
                  <p>It is true the Councell of Trent doth decree that none expound the ſcriptures contrarie to the vniforme conſent of Fathers, yea &amp; Pius Quintus doth alſo declare in his Bull of the profeſſion of faith that ſuch as are preferred to dignities &amp; places of care of ſoules take an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2119:296"/> oath of the ſame; but as they take the oath ſo doe they performe alſo the obligation of it. And I demand of Sir Humfrey who hath ſuch a great talent in reprehending, whether he thinkes not in his conſcience that thoſe who vnder the ſtrict bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of oath are obliged to anie matter, are not more like to performe it then thoſe who haue no ſuch obligation whereby to reſtraine their actions? ſurelie there is a great difference in the circumſtances, &amp; conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie a great reaſon to iudge that thoſe Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts who haue ſuch an oath obliging them to followe the conſent of Fathers in their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of ſcripture, will be farre more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to performe the ſame then the reformed Doctours who haue no ſuch bridle to refraine the inclination to noueltie of their itching witts,</p>
                  <p>Now wheras Sir Humfrey after his ordinary cauilling manner doth ſay, that if the Romane Church can make good the vniforme conſent of Fathers for their twelue new articles of faith he will liſten to their interpretation &amp; preferre it before any priuate or later expoſition, this I ſay is a meere ſophiſme in regard that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church doth not teach as he ignorantly miſtakes, that he who interpreteth ſcriptures muſt haue poſitiuely the vniforme conſent of Fathers for his expoſitions, but onely that he muſt not wittingly expound any place of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2119:296"/> in matters of moment eſpecially in faith &amp; manners contrary to the whole torrent of the ſame Fathers; the which becauſe the kinght did not rightly vnderſtand as it ſeemes when he read the Concell &amp; the Bull of Pius, he abuſeth Caietane, Canus, Andradius, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Baronius, &amp; other moderne Romaniſts as if they had contradicted the foreſaid decree, wheras yet one of them to wit Caietan writ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was eſtablished, the reſt being knowne for notorius defenders of it: &amp; ſo running vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon falſe grownes, the wandering knight paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth forward citing among Romaniſts ſome of his conſorts, &amp; building his By-way (to omitt others of leſſe moment, &amp; diuerſe ſcurrilous ſcoffes touching the application of ſcriptures by the Romaniſts notobſtanding its well knowne he &amp; his companions are much more guilty in that kinde) with two notorious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes affirming that all the priſtes &amp; Ieſuites are ſworne not to receaue &amp; interpret ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but according to the vniforme conſent of Fathers, &amp; that it is an article of the Roman faith ſo to doe: all which needes no further examen in regard that to any iuditious reader theſe two particulars onely will be ſufficient to acquaint him which the reſt of the authors iugling trickes which he vſeth in this part of his by-way, which being voyde of ſubſtantiall matter it ſuteth beſt to him that made it, but

                  <p>I haue treated of this in parte in my former Cenſure, to which I adde returning that Sir Humfrey ſaith of Campion vppon himſelf, which is that if this Nouelliſt had binne as reall in his proofes as he is prodigall in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, he had gome beyond all the reformed proſelites ſinces the daies of Luther, for neuer man made greater florishes with proorer proofes, all that he bringeth being founded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſame equiuocation which he vſed in his ſafe way conſiſting of this propoſition, the Fathers of euery age haue acknowledged the 22. bookes of ſcripture which the reformed Churches hold for Canonicall to be the true Canon &amp; no other.

And now I verilie perſuade my ſelfe it is moſt true which a certaine ingenious Proteſtant ſayd of the Puritans, that they will rather affoord ten lyes then one oath. In his verie firſte wordes he affirmes that to admit traditions &amp; other conſtitutions of the Church is the firſte article of the Roman Creed to which all Bishops &amp; Preiſts are ſworne, citing in the margen the Bull of Pius the fourth: this is his firſt lye in this ſection, but he will make ſure it shall not

But alas for pittie, his dreame proued ſo falſe that when he awaked he found himſelfe in the channell; for in neyther of thoſe places are thoſe wordes found, nay nor yet the ſenſe which he intendeth heere, which being no other then that onelie ſcriptures &amp; no tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be followed in anie matter of faith or manners, neyther thoſe two places of ſcripture nor anie other teſtimonie that he bringeth ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of anie ſcripture or Fathers doth proue his peremptorie poſition, but onelie shewe that all ſcriptures are profitable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct a man in all good workes to the end he may be perfect, &amp; moreouer that the ſcriptures be as Bellarmine ſayth a moſt certaine &amp; moſt ſafe rule of faith; yet that they be the ſole or onelie certaine &amp; ſafe rule, neyther Bellarmine nor anie other Romaniſt, nor yet anie proofe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2119:302"/> or teſtimonie which the knight produceth doth eyther teach or teſtifie.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sec. 10.</note> From hence Sir Humfrey paſſeth to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other matter, that is to the teſtimonies of the ancient fathers, where he chargeth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts that they eyther openly reiect them, or ſecretly decline their authority by euaſions in particular pointes. This is the tenth ſection
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2119:302"/> a great part of which is repeated out of his firſte booke &amp; anſered by me in my cenſure. He makes a large preamble touching the clayme the Romaniſts make to the ancient fathers as patrons of their doctrine, &amp; as if they did arrogate that which is not their owne: but the diſcourſe is very idle &amp; <hi>mutatis mudandis,</hi> may be verie iuſtely verified of the knight &amp; his predeceſſors, eſpeciallie Iewell &amp; Pleſſis who both of them were the greateſt braggars in that kind that euer were, &amp; yet none ſo shameleſſe in corrupting the Fathers workes &amp; abuſing their ſenſe, as themſelues. The reſt of this ſection is verie meane ſtuffe conſiſting of captious conſtructions of the ſayeings of ſome Romaniſts, &amp; contorting them to this matter as if they did diſeſteeme or reiect the ancient Fathers authoritie which is impoſſible to be true, as is manifeſtlie conuinced by the continuall vſe they make of them much more then the Nouelliſts, as it is well knowne to the world: And the truth is that the Romaniſts onelie modeſtlie confeſſe eſpeciallie when they are vrged to it by the clamours of the ſectaries, that ſome of the Fathers in their ſingle opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or in ſuch caſes as they did not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent together, did ſometimes perhapps fall into ſome erroneous point of doctrine, &amp; that they are not alwayes &amp; in euerie point to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in their expoſitions of ſcriptures or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2119:303"/> in matters nothing concerning the controuerſies of theſe tymes: But onelie when they all agree in matters of faith, or by graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that in pointes of practiſe (for example about the Communion in one kinde or priuate Maſſe) they are not all &amp; in all matters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſlie for them: How beit they knowe they neither are againſt them all things conſidered. Which if it be duelie pondered is no inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience at all, in regard that theſe things &amp; ſuch others be mutable according to the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of times &amp; perſons, &amp; conſequentlie might be otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by practiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by vs. Neyther doe the Romaniſts when they affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the Fathers to be for them teach (as the knight doth falſelie &amp; deceitfullie ſuppoſe) that all the Fathers in euerie point of faith be it tranſubſtantiation or anie other, are poſitiuelie for them; but onelie that the whole ſtreame nay nor anie part of them is poſitiuelie againſt them in anie ſuch doctrine, &amp; that in the moſt pointes they are expreſſelie &amp; wholie for them, &amp; againſt the reformers in all.</p>

                  <p>Neyther yet doe any of the teſtimonyes which the kinght produceth for his accuſation of Bellarmine in this nature proue his intent, nor any thing more then that both Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine &amp; other Romaniſts doe indeed ſome times produce ſuch authors in fauour of their doctrine as are not by all Romaniſts held to be of certaine &amp; vndoubted authority, or at the leaſt not certainly iudged to be the workes of thoſe authors whoſe names they beare, thou' otherwiſe althoſe who cite them hold them for workes of ancient ſtanding &amp; not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, at leaſt in the ſubſtance of theie autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as the knight doth counterfeitly indeuore to perſwade his reader: nay Bellarmine whome

And I pray you what is this preamble to the purpoſe of prouing the Roman faith not to haue binne taught by the ancient Fathers or the primitiue Church? the knight produceth certaine places out of ſainct Auguſtine, &amp; Ambroſe, to proue that they preferred ſcriptures before the writings of the Fathers, &amp; that they appealed from them to ſcriptures: but what Romaniſt in the world denyeth that the ſcriptures haue incomparable preheminence aboue all other writings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer? or what Roman Catholike doth not willinglie graunt that when the ſcriptures are plaine &amp; the doctrine of the Fathers obſcure or doubtfull, prouocation from them to the ſcriptures is rightlie made: But that euen in ſuch caſes as the Fathers doe vniformlie agree in matter of faith or generallie receaued pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Church, it is vſuall &amp; lawfull to appeale from them to ſcriptures, eſpeciallie when they are not plaine &amp; manifeſt; this I ſay neyther thoſe holie Fathers produced by the knight did euer teach, neyther can anie reaſon be found to proue it, but rather it is cleerlie againſt all reaſon, as opening the by-way to all ſortes of hereſie.</p>
                  <p>And if Sir Humfrey when he read S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine <hi>contra Creſcon:</hi> had but paſſed one other
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2119:305"/> ſtep forward, he might haue found that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Father not to appeale to ſcripture onelie, but alſo to the authoritie of the Church, ſince that preſentlie after he had ſayd that he held not ſainct Cyprians epiſtle for Canonicall, but examined it by Canonicall ſcripture (which are the words our aduerſarie cites) he addes &amp; that with a great emphaſis ſayeing. <hi>Non acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio inquam, I ſay I doe not receaue that which S.

Cyprian, but he ſtruck the laſt ſtroake by force of the authoritie of the Catholike Church. And thus you ſee Sir Humfrey is ſtill out of the way of the Fathers which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe citeth, if they be ritelie vnderſtood; &amp; followeth his owne crooked tract, relating the particular pointes of the Roman doctrine vnfaithfullie as he vſeth to doe &amp; making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie conditionall promiſes to ſubſcribe in caſe the ancient Fathers be found for vs, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the performance to his next opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which is ſo farre to ſeeke that I aſſure my ſelfe he will neuer finde it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Sec. 13.</note> In his next enſueing ſection which is the 13. in number, he pretends that S. Gregorie who ſent S. Auguſtine the monke into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to preach the Chriſtian faith is directlie oppoſite to the Roman religion in the mayne pointes of faith.</p>
                  <p>By the contents of this ſection it appeeres that the knight is as fitte to write matters of diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as an aſſe is fitte to play on the fiddle, &amp; he makes ſuch fiddling worke as one may plainlie perceiue that eyther he doth not vnderſtand the Fathers, &amp; other Catholike authors that write in Latin, or that paſſion &amp; malice quite obfuſcate his witts when he reades them. In his 350. page he affirmes that in the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted writings of Gregorie there will be found few or no ſubſtantiall pointes which are not agreable to the tenets of their Church, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together different from the Roman, this he ſayth but in ſtead of proofe comming to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars he committs diuers palpable fraudes: for firſte whereas he profeſſeth to compare
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2119:307"/> the doctrine of Tridentine Councell &amp; his owne with the doctrine of ſainct Gregorie in lieu of that he cites the doctrine of Bellarmine, the notes vpon the Rhemes teſtament, &amp; the expurgatorie Index, which altho' they be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall Catholike authors, yet are they not rules of the Roman faith. Neither yet doth our aduerſarie conuince them to be repugnant to ſainct Gregories true meaning in anie one point of faith. And I earneſtlie wish I had time &amp; place to diſcouer to the reader the egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fraude the knight hath vſed in his tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; interpretation of this holie Fathers wordes touching the real preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt: <note place="margin">Greg. in 6. pſ. poenit.</note> for by this onelie paſſage, he might frame a coniecture of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie wheras our aduerſarie treateth in this ſection of ſubſtantiall pointes of faith, yet ſome of the particulars in which he exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifies, are not ſubſtantiall points of faith, but rather of manners which according to diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of times may alter &amp; change, as priuate Maſſe, the double Communion, reading of ſcriptures in vulgar language, in which there is a mayne difference from matters of faith, which can neuer varie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie of all the pointes which he rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth being all as I take it 9. in number. There is but onelie one in which it can be ſayd with anie coulourable probabilitie that ſainct Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2119:307"/> in anie of the places heere cited doth contradict the doctrine of the Roman Church, &amp; that is the point of the Canon of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in which patricular althou' he refuſed to giue the bookes of Machabees the title of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall ſcripture, (as yet S. Auguſtine &amp; others did before him, &amp; the reſt of the writers, for the moſt parte, euer ſince haue donne (whether it were becauſe he ment onelie they were not contained in the Canon of the Iewes, or for that the whole Church had not then declared them for Canonicall vnder that name) Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he is not to be iudged more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the doctrine of the preſent Roman Church in that point, then thoſe who notob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that in the primitiue Church certaine bookes of the new Teſtament, as the epiſtle to the Hebrewes &amp; others, were doubted of, yet now with infallible certaintie &amp; faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue them for diuine, &amp; ſacred ſcripture, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thou' they were not accounted &amp; beleiued for ſuch by all the orthodoxall Fathers of the Church in all former ages ſince the time of the Apoſtles who firſte published them to the world. Eſpeciallie conſidering that the ſame ſainct Gregorie neuer denyed neyther in the place cited nor in anie other of his workes, but that as the declaration of the Church was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to aſſure all faithfull people that thoſe bookes of which before his dayes there had
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2119:308"/> binne doubt, were then trulie Canonicall ſcripture thou' not knowne for ſuch in euerie age before him: ſo might the ſame ſucceeding Church in later times determine the like of thoſe bookes which in his time ſo generallie &amp; vndoubtedlie were not as yet held for ſuch. Neyther according to the rules of diuinitie can that man be reputed not to be of the ſame religion of which another is, becauſe he now beleaueth ſome thing more in the materiall obiect of faith then the other did in that time in which he liued; but at the moſt it can onelie be truelie verified that he hath the ſame habit of faith thou' ſome what more extended in the obiect, as neyther the Apoſtles were of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe faith when they were firſte inſtructed by Chriſte before his paſſion from that they had after his reſurrection, when yet doubtleſſe they receaued more expreſſe, &amp; extenſiue knowledge in matters of faith then before they had receiued. And ſure I am S. Gregorie without exception cites both the booke of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, &amp; Eccleſiaſticus: &amp; ſapience moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie: none of which bookes neuertheleſſe the miſreformers admit for the worde of God. And till Sir Humfrey or ſome of his aſſociates can produce out of S. Auguſtin &amp; S. Gregorie as plaine &amp; pregnant places either for his owne tenets, or againſt the Roman doctrine as the Romaniſts haue long ſince produced for theirs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2119:308"/> as their workes vpon euerie ſeuerall contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie make apparent, let them for shame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer claime them for theirs in anie one point of controuerſie: for notobſtanding they make a plauſible vſe of ſome fewe patches of their more ambiguous, ill conſtrued, &amp; ill related ſentences, yet turne but the iudicious &amp; vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall reader to the bookes them ſelues, &amp; he will ingenuouſlie confeſſe &amp; abſolutelie crye a loud, all is ours.</p>
                  <p>And if it would pleaſe his maieſtie of his royall clemencie to ſuffer vs freelie to make tryall of our cauſe by ſcripture, &amp; Fathers, I knowe which ſide would be founde <hi>minus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens,</hi> manie graines to light. But it is our great miſerie (yet in one ſenſe our great happines) to be ſo croſſed &amp; curbed with ſeueritie of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral lawes that we cannot be ſafe in the moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate corners, much leſſe can we appeare in any publike aſſemblie for defenſe of our Religion. <note place="margin">Vid.

                  <p>But yet ſuppoſing that S.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2119:309"/> from hence it manifeſtlie appeereth how farre Sir Humfrey hath walked by the way, when in the end of his eleauenth ſection he auouched his reader should plainlie diſcerne how the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Popes &amp; Bishops doe differ from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, &amp; how theſe two Fathers of the Church (meaning ſainct Auguſtine &amp; ſainct Gregorie) concurre expreſſelie with the doctrine profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the reformed Churches different from the Roman; it being moſt apparent by the premiſſes, that by anie thing which he hath heere produced out of the foreſayd Fathers, he hath neyther proued anie one point of his owne religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor diſproued ours; but hath one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie preſtigiouſlie deluded the eyes of the reader with a coulorable florish, &amp; yet in realitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſtill in the ſame byway in which he hath hitherto walked ſeparate from the royall ſtreet of the ancient Doctors of the primitiue Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sec. 14.</note> The next ſection being the fourteenth is that the ingenuous Romaniſts confeſſe that the Councells which they oppoſe againſt the Reformers, were neyther called by lawfull authoritie, nor to the right ends.</p>
                  <p>Heere I finde that to be moſt true which a pleaſant Proteſtant pronounceth of the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ſayeing, their religion willinglie admitts no founder, but Bragger &amp; they flourished much about a time. And in ſober ſadnes the beſt Sir Humfrey can make of his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2119:309"/> confeſſion throu' out his whole worke in fauour of his doctrine, doth nothing more then plainlie conuince him to be of no other progenie: Neyther doe their confeſſions fit his purpoſe anie better then if he should put his shooes vpon his handes, or his hoſe vpon his head.</p>
                  <p>A patterne of this you may ſee in this verie ſection, in which how ſoeuer he vaunteth of the confeſſion of his aduerſaries, &amp; that by two principall conditions (as he ſayth) ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie in vſe for the authoritie of Councells are both acknowledged to be abrogated by later Councells, to wit becauſe, quoth the knight, now a dayes the Pope calls Councells without right, &amp; he &amp; his aſſemble them in their owne name &amp; for their owne ends: for proofe of which calumnious poſition he cites but onely two authors &amp; thoſe ſcarce held for ſound mettle among the Romaniſts: neyther yet doth eyther of them plainlie auerre his poſition as it is vttered by him; but they onelie ſpeake by way of reprehenſion of ſuch abuſes as might be practiſed in that nature by the malice of men without taxing the Pope or anie other in particular, as the knight would maliciouſlie inferre out of their wordes for the confirmation of the ſiniſter opinion he hath of the Church of Rome &amp; her head in earth. The reſt which he hath in this ſection is but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2119:310"/> eyther his owne bare aſſertions &amp; thoſe not true, as that from Moyſes to the Machabies all temporall Princes practiſed power of calling aſſemblies, &amp; that aſſoone as Kings receiued the Chriſtian faith they executed the ſame power, &amp; that the later Councells celebrated in the Roman Church are not aſſembled in the name of Chriſte: all the reſt I ſay is eyther ſuch ſtuffe as this, or elſe malitious corruptions of ſome Roman diuines as appeeres in Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min &amp; Valentia, the ſenſe of both which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors he deceitfullie peruerteth, the one lib. 1. de Concil. cap. 10. the other tom. 3. d. 1. q. 2. p. 5. by which falſe &amp; indirect dealing he doth nothing in this whole ſection but shewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to proceed in that by-way which his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors Luther &amp; Caluin haue shewed him in their corrupted writings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sec. 15.</note> In the 15. ſection Sir Humfrey affirmeth that Councells giue no ſupport to the Romish religion: In his former ſection he profeſſed great reuerence &amp; reſpect towards the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Councells eſpeciallie the fower firſte, yet heere he ſpareth not the verie firſte Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell of thoſe ſame fower which he ſo highlie commended before, but at once he ſtriketh at no leſſe then 60. of the 80. Canons it is commonlie held to containe, like a ſquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyed waterman looking one way &amp; roweing another, iuſt, as he did before in his feigned
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2119:310"/> commendation of traditions &amp; Fathers. But let the reader marke what this man is to proue &amp; how prepoſterouſlie he proueth it, &amp; he will preſentlie iudge him not to be ſquinteyed onelie, but eyther ſtarke blind or ſtarke mad.</p>
                  <p>He is to proue as he ſayth firſte that manie generall &amp; particular Councells haue erred in euerie age which yet are produced for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man religion, but how doth he proue this I praye? marie becauſe the Councell of Cayphas ſayth he, is confeſſed by Bellarmine to haue perniciouſlie erred when it adiudged Chriſte a blaſphemer, therefore by Bellarmines confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Councells produced for the Roman reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may erre. <hi>Obſtupeſcite caeli!</hi> O yee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens ſtand yee aſtonished to heere this mans logike! &amp; this being his firſte card iudge what the reſt of his hand may be, &amp; how like he is to conclude, who argueth from Cayphas to Chriſte, from the old lawe to the new, from a Councell of falſe Iewes to Councells of true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: <note place="margin">Vid.

                  <p>He paſſeth to the ſecond age &amp; ſayth that the Councell of Antioch is cited by Gretzerus, by Turrian, by Baronius for the worship of images, &amp; yet that the firſte publishers of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2119:311"/> Councells neuer mentioned it. But what is this to the purpoſe of prouing that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Romaniſts manie decrees &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of Councells by them produced for the Roman religion are counterfeit or deuiſed to proue the Trent doctrine? doth it follow that becauſe ſome publishers of Councells did not find this Councell or other ſuch like in their dayes, therefore they did confeſſe them for ſpurious or Apochriphall or that thoſe who afterwards haue brought them to light as the authors aboue named Baronius Turrian &amp; Binnius haue not as much authoritie to publish them for authenticall as you &amp; your criticall Cooke to denie them or condemne them for counterfeit; <note place="margin">Cenſura Patr.</note> eſpeciallie conſidering that thoſe who allow this particular Councell of which we now ſpeake, are all knowne to be of farre greater knowledge in matters of antiquitie then thoſe that collected Councells before them, to witt Merlin &amp; Crabbe Surius &amp; Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colinus, who althou' they be one more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then thoſe moderne Romaniſts who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe this firſt Councell of Antioch as found in the librarie of ancient Origen, yet neyther doth the greater number contradict the leſſe, nor yet if they did haue they ſo much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie as to preuaile before them.</p>
                  <p>In the third age the knight ſetts the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian Councell celebrated by S. Cyprian
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2119:311"/> &amp; his Collegues, which Councell, ſayth the knight, may ſerue to proue that ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells rightly called are diſchareged by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, adding that this Councell is therfore reiected by the Romaniſts by reaſon that S. Cyprian &amp; the whole Councell appoſed the title of the Popes ſupremacie.</p>
                  <p>But in this proofe Sir Humfrey committeth diuers groſſe faultes, firſte in that he ſuppoſeth falſely that a Councell orderly conuocated ought not to be reiected, which is a poſition that I am ſure no Romaniſt, &amp; as I thinke, no ſectary before Sir Humfrey euer defended: &amp; the reaſon is for that it is not the aſſemblie, but the proceeding &amp; concluding of a Councell is that which giues it deciſiue authority, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Councell without definitions ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions &amp; confirmation should neceſſarily be receaued, which is moſt abſurd.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the kinght telleth his reader a manifeſt vntruth, where he affirmeth that the foreſayd Councell is therfore diſchareged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe S. Cyprian &amp; the whole Councell appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the title of the Popes ſupremacie; for that Councell was aſſembled onely about rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization of thoſe which had binne baptiſed by heretiques, neyther is there any mention of the Popes authority eyther good or bad: but onely S. Cyprian by way of preface or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention warneth thoſe Bishops that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2119:312"/> that euery one deliuer his ſentence or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditt freely without iudging one another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſaith he, none of vs doth conſtitute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Bishop of Bishopps, &amp; ſo what is this I pray to the Bishop of Rome or Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy whome S. Cyprian ſo much reſpected that euen in this occaſion as S. Hierome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, <note place="margin">Dialog. aduerſ. Lucif.</note> he directed his ſinod to Pope Stephan, which is an euident ſigne that he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Popes ſupreme authority, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did diſetely in that his fact acknowledge the ſame. Thirdly Sir Humfrey dealeth falſely when for concluſion of this point he ſaith that this may ſerue for proofe, that Councells righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly called are deſcharged by his aduerſaries, when they make againſt the Trent faith, it being manifeſt that this Synod containes not any one of thoſe matters which he contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly termeth the Tridentine faith. From whence it appeeres that in ſteed of proofes the liberall kinght hath giuen vs his owne impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures: And thus it fareth with him throu' all this ſection captiouſly concluding vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall propoſitions of particulars, as that ſome Romaniſts doe cite for the Popes ſupremacy one or two Councells of whoſe authority others make doubt, therfore the doctrine of the Popes ſupremacy is wholely grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vncertaine Councells: notobſtanding he himſelf acknowledgeth that beſides theſe few
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2119:312"/> doubt full authorities, there be many more in number cited by Bellarmine &amp; others that are vndoubted: &amp; with ſuch ſophiſticall illations mingling diuers equiuocations &amp; falſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, confounding generall Councells with particular &amp; confounding truth with falſity, yea &amp; much falſity without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of truth, he concludeth his ſection in ſuch a fashion as it is eaſie for anie that hath his witts about him to perceaue he intendeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to leade his reader into that ſame by-way which he ſtill laboureth to finish for himſelf &amp; others of his owne profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sec. 16.</note> In his ſixteenth ſection the knight makes hoat warre againſt the Councell of Trent; &amp; after he had in a couning &amp; ſecret manner ſpit his poyſon at diuers other Councells of more ancient ſtanding in the precedent ſection, he ſingles this out alone as his moſt profeſſed enimy, &amp; moſt ſeuere cenſurer of his faultes &amp; crimes, vſing all his whole forces &amp; art to diminish his ſtrength &amp; power, &amp; that not in hugger mugger but in plaine &amp; manifeſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: affirming the ſame to be of ſmale or no credit as being neyther lawfully called nor free, nor eyther generall or generally receiued. He ſayth it was not lawfully called becauſe it was aſſembled by the Popes vſurped authority &amp; not by the Emperour: but this being the firſte part of he proofe, it is both falſe in it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2119:313" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſelf &amp; alſo left vnproued otherwiſe then by his naked affirmation, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sereniſſimo etiam Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratori gratias a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, &amp; gratulari iure optimo debemus. — ille de nostris his rebus pro ſua ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imia pieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſollicitus mirifice fuit</hi> Orat. hab. ſeſ. 9.</note> &amp; ſo it needes no other confutation then denyall; how beit ſo certaine &amp; manifeſt it is that the Emperour conſented vn to that Councell &amp; approued both the conuocation &amp; proceedings of it (as much as lay in his power) that I am perſuaded the ſectaries them ſelues with all their audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe haue not the face to deny ſo playne a truth, &amp; ſo plainely expreſſed in the oration had in the laſt ſeſſion of the ſacred ſynod, in which great thankes ar rendered vnto him for his zeale &amp; care therin imployed.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the proofe conſiſts of a falſe ſuppoſition that no Councell can be legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate except it be conuocated by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: but that this is falſe it is clearer then the day, otherwiſe it would follow that thoſe Councells which were celebrated before there were any Chriſtian Emperour in the world should haue binne vnlaufully called, as euen that of the Apoſtles themſelues: <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> &amp; more if that poſition of the nouelliſts were true, what truth or authority can the Councells of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue reformed Churches haue, none of which as yet had euer any Emperour of their religion (&amp; as I hope in God neuer will haue) at leaſt ſince the daies of Luther euen by their owne confeſſions: which pouerty of their poore rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged flock it ſeemes Sir Humfrey had quite
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2119:313"/> forgotte when he vttered that falſe maxime of the reformed doctrine. Secondly he ſayth, the Councell of Trent was not free, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hi (nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cij) Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon is partes prope om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grarunt, rogarunt, obſecraru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, obteſtati ſunt, tuta omnia, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que amica promiſeru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. &amp;c</hi> Orat. vt ſupra.</note> &amp; yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth in this ſame place that he denieth not but that ſafe conduct was promiſed as well to the Lutherans as to the Romaniſts, &amp; yet as it ſeemes like cowardelie daſtardes they feared danger, <hi>timuerunt vbi non erattimor.</hi> And if they feared where there was no feare in whome I praye was the fault? now for freedome of ſpeech in propoſing of matters &amp; diſcuſſing them Sir Humfrey cannot deny if he will ſtand to the teſtimony of his owne Dudithius cited by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who plainly ſuppoſeth freedome in that nature, in that he affirmes being a Proteſtant that the feild had binne theirs if they had not binne ouercome by number.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly he affirmes that it was not generall, but how could it be more generall then by a generall &amp; amicable conuocation of all Princes Prelates &amp; learned diuines, which the Bull of indiction declares. And as for the number of thoſe who came vnto it thou' the knight doth vſe all his art for the diminution of it, yet was it farre greater then he vouchſafed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as the Catalogue prefixed to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell doth plainly declare, amounting to the number of 255. <note place="margin">Acclam.

Neuertheleſſe in matters of faith it is generally receaued of all Roman Catholikes wher ſoeuer they bee, farre or neere, in Europe Aſia, or America, or other forreigne Countries conuerted to the chriſtian Catholike faith, &amp; ſo the reader may ſee that this ſaieng of our aduerſaries which they perpetually buzze into the eares of the ſimple people that the Councell of Trent is not generally receaued by the Romaniſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, is meere couſenage &amp; impoſture mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly inuented to auert their mindes from the moſt wholeſome doctrine &amp; profitable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the ſame for the generall reformation of the Church, which becauſe the falſe refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers plainly ſee it trenches to neere vppon their Copyhold, they ioyne heauen &amp; hell together to infringe its authority.

                  <p>Althou' the name &amp; authoritie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church hath euer binne ſo odious to all ſortes of ſectaries, that they made it a cheife parte of their labours to impugne the ſame, of which, ſeuerall inſtances might eaſilie be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: yet this practiſe of theirs hath neuer bin ſo much vſed or ſo earneſtly purſued as in theſe preſent tymes. For as it is well knowne that their Captaine &amp; Anteſignane Luther ſtrucke his firſte ſtroake at the Pope &amp; Churches power to graunt indulgences, ſo is it alſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by experience, that all his followers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame battle with all their ſtrenght &amp; ſtratagems. For proofe of which wee need goe no further then to this our aduerſarie. Who throu' his whole workes laboureth nothing more then to diminish the luſtre, &amp; power of the Catholike Roman Church; in ſo much that in this verie ſection he maketh choiſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lay violent hands vpon the ſacred Bible, &amp; shamefullie to corrupt three ſeuerall places

                  <p>The firſte place therefore conſiſts in diuers paſſages of the epiſtle to the Romans eſpecially in the firſte chapter, where that which the Apoſtle by way of admonition ſpeaketh onely to thoſe particular Chriſtians &amp; members of the Church which were then at Rome, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to be conſtant in their faith &amp; humble themſelues leaſt God cut them of for their ſinnes as he did the Iewes; the knight doth violentlie drawe it to the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

And the like abuſe of the knight the reader may ſee in other places which he cites to the ſame purpoſe viz. to proue that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church is faileable as 1. Theſſal. 8.2. Theſſal. 3.1. Tim. 3.15. Epheſ. 3.14. In all which places he vſeth much of his accuſtomed craft peruerting the ſenſe moſt ſacrilegiouſlie
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2119:316"/> in all thoſe ſacred texts, &amp; in the firſte to the Corinthians he falſifieth the wordes, putting <hi>thou</hi> for <hi>vs,</hi> the particulars of which I am ſorie I cannot ſtande to examine, to the end his groſſe couſenage might more cleerlie appeare, and how vnder coulour of ſcriptures the ſacred word of God &amp; truth is adulterated euen by him who ſo much braggeth &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in it.</p>
                  <p>After this ſame fashion he eludeth two pregnant places of Fathers for the authoritie of the Church the one is of Sainct Cypr. lib. 1. epiſt. 3. the other is of ſainct Auguſtine contra epiſt. fund. cap. 5. &amp; to coulore his euaſion about the wordes of ſainct Auguſtine which are theſe, <note place="margin">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2119:317"/> which Canus doth not denie, <note place="margin">Lib. 7. de Canon. c. 10.</note> but profeſſedlie maintayneth &amp; particularlie in the verie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent chapter in other places in a moſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike manner.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe the knight alſo cites Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, Driedo, &amp; Gerſon, but rehearſeth not their wordes which notobſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding I haue ſeene cited by Chamier; but if they be truly &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerelie vnderſtood, they conuince nothing againſt the infallible authoritie of the Church, as neyther the wordes of ſainct Thomas who onelie affirmeth that ſainct Auguſtine ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the Church as an oueruling cauſe, but not as the foundation of faith, which no Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts denies, but all vniformely teach that their faith is founded vpon the word of God, whoſe onelie authoritie is the ſupreme rule of the ſame, but the Church the proponent onelie.</p>
                  <p>In the reſt of his ſection Sir Humfrey makes a diuerſion to the vniuerſalitie of the Church for which he onely produceth ſome imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent reaſons of no force with the authorities of the Councells of Ferrara &amp; Baſill, waldenſis &amp; others, none of which proues any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning to the matter in treaty, but onely ſerue to patch vp this part of his bypath, in which I leaue him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sec. 19.</note> The 19. ſection following affirmeth that the Church is finally reſolued into the Pope,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2119:317"/> whome ſaith the kinght the Romaniſts make the husband &amp; the ſpouſe, the head, &amp; the bodie of the Church. This man is ſo full of falſity &amp; vntruth that it ſeemes his whole li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing is by lyeing, I am perſwaded he hath had his breeding in braſen faced College where impudency &amp; vntruth are the cheefe leſſons in the ſchooles. And heere the kinght hath in a manner gone beyonde if not beſide himſelf in that faculty. For I finde no leſſe then there lyes euen with in the narrow limits of the title of his ſection: nay there is not any one part or parcell of it true, by which alone althou' the reader might make a ſtrong coniecture of the reſt, yet will I giue him an inſtance or two in particular which doubtleſſe will quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince his iudgment of the authors knauish dealing.</p>
                  <p>In his 502. page, now at laſt ſaith he, they haue made him (meaning the Pope) the whole Church in ſo much that ſome are not ashamed to profeſſe that the Pope may diſpenſe againſt the Apoſtles, yea againſt the new teſtament vppon good cauſe, &amp; alſo againſt all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the old. This lye is ſo exorbitant &amp; monſtrous, that it ſeemes he who made it doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it would not be taken vppon his owne bare word, wherfore he fled to the authority of his frend Iewell whome he quotes in the margent to make it more authenticall, as if that famous
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2119:318"/> Father of falſe dealing could ſufficiently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all that which in that nature is wanting in himſelf. But I hope the iudicious reader will regiſter them both in one predicament &amp; giue no more credit to the one then the other, but ſend them togeather to the whetſtone.</p>
                  <p>Another inſtance I giue the reader out of the 504. page, where the knight chargeth Bellarmine to teach that if the Pope should ſo much erre as to command vices &amp; forbid vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the Church were bound to beleiue that vices are good &amp; virtues euill, vnleſſes she will ſinne againſt her conſcience. It is true the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall hath the ſame wordes which Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey cites hitherto, but yet he vſeth moſt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt &amp; double dealing, in regare that if he had either rehearſed the whole place intirely as it lieth in Bellarmine, or elſe had veiwed his recognition, he might eaſily haue found the authors true meaning to be, not that in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall &amp; euery matter &amp; all occaſions, but onely that in doubtful caſes &amp; in things not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily good or ill of themſelues, &amp; in matters indifferent, ſuch obedience is to be giuen to the Pope, leaſt otherwiſe men should proceed againſt their conſciences, &amp; therfore ſaith he, <hi>Si Papa,</hi> If the Pope should command that which is cleerly knowne to be a vice, or should prohibite that which is cleerly knowne to be a virtue, then we ought rather to obey God
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2119:318"/> then men. And ſo we ſee, that taking away the impoſture &amp; couſinage of the kinght, there is nothing in Bellarmines doctrine that may either iuſtly offend the reader, or that makes for the purpoſe heere intended of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that the Pope ought to be obeyed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his doctrine be true or falſe, as our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary doth falſely &amp; calumniouſly affirme. All the reſt which the knight hath in this ſection is onely ſophiſticall fopperies &amp; crackes of his crazed braine abuſing the doctrine of diuers Romaniſts &amp; framing ſuch ſenſe to their words as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth neerſte to his owne purpoſe &amp; is fartheſt from theirs, &amp; ſo falſely fathering it vppon them, &amp; confounding the faith of the whole Church with matters diſputable &amp; in opinion, he concludes diſcourſe of all which let the reader conſider whether the Romaniſts or he himſelf rather be not in the by-way he hath fallaciouſly framed for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sec. 20.</note> In the ſection followeing which is the 20. in order, he affirmes, that the Church, which he ſaith is reſolued finally into the Pope, hath neither perſonall nor doctrinall ſucceſſion, neyther in matter of faith nor fact.</p>
                  <p>It appeeres by the knights proceedings in this whole ſection, that he hath met with his greateſt enimie againſt whome he vſeth all his art &amp; cunning hoping to haue the maſtrie by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2119:319"/> ſtriking moſt ſtronglie at the head that is the Pope, whome to make his bloue the fuller, he feignes to be the whole bodie, &amp; like a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſpider gathering poyſon from the fraga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t flowers of the Roman doctrine ſpits the verie quiteſſence of it againſt his ſacred perſon. Yet a great part of his matter is but loathſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcations of that which he hath a hundred times repeated, &amp; which haue binne as often anſeared by my ſelfe &amp; others. But becauſe his importunitie is ſo great, I will giue the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a taſte, thou' I confeſſe it is moſt tedious vnto me to eate ſo often of the ſame Crambe.</p>
                  <p>The knights cheife plot in this place is by confronting the doctrine of the ancient Popes not onelie in matters of fact, but of faith alſo with the moderne doctrine of the Roman Churches &amp; Popes, he beginnes with priuate Maſſe ſayeing that Pope Anacletus did decree that after conſecration, all preſent should communicate according as the Apoſtles ſet downe, &amp; the Roman Church then obſerued. Now this Sir Humfrey compareth with the doctrine of the late Councell of Trent, which determines, vnder paine of excommunication, that Maſſes in which the Preiſts alone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates are not vnlawfull or to be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as if this decree were contrarie to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which directlie it is not, for that althou' the wordes of Anaclet doe shewe the common
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2119:319"/> cuſtome of his time, yea &amp; of the Church of his time (notwithſtanding they alſo inſinuate that the contrarie had binne practiſed at the leaſt in ſome places) to haue binne that all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at Maſſe did <hi>de facto</hi> communicate, yea &amp; that thoſe, that did not should be put out: Yet in regard the Councell of Trent doth neyther denie nor diſſallowe of that cuſtome (nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſlie deſires the continuation of it) but onelie defineth that ſuch Maſſes as are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated without more communicants beſides the Preiſt are not to be condemned &amp; abollish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed as the clamorous ſectaries of our daies doe contend, it is more then euident that there is no contrarietie to be founde betweene the one &amp; the other, nor more then if the ſame Councell had defined, that thoſe Communions are not vnlawfull, or not to be condemned in which infants are not admitted to receaue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, notobſtanding the cuſtome was in the primitiue Church to admitte them. To omitte that Sir Humfrey is verie ignorant in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Roman Church if he knoweth not that althou' in matters of faith there can be no chaunge, yet in matters of manners al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration may be made; ſo that according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of times, places, &amp; perſons, that which once hath binne practiſed yea &amp; commanded by one Pope &amp; Councell at one time, may be otherwiſe practiſed in another, &amp; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2119:320"/> anie preiudice, but rather with great profit (in ſome caſes) to the vniuerſal Church which doctrine becauſe the knight wanteth eyther witt or will to conceiue it rightlie, he runneth a madding throu' his whole ſection vpon an erroneous ſuppoſition prouing nothing but his owne ſpleene againſt the Pope, &amp; want of vnderſtanding, &amp; iudgement.</p>
                  <p>And in this ſame Frantick fashion he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with ſainct Gregorie in his 9. epiſtle of the Regiſter; &amp; the Bull of Pius quartus concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning images, equiuocating in the word <hi>adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which by reaſon holie S. Gregorie takes it for diuine honour, he teacheth with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that althou' images may be lawfullie made &amp; vſed with due reuerence as he sheweth in another place, yet they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be lawfullie ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the other ſenſe. From whence Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey will needes collect that the moderne Pope Pius contradicteth that which his famous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor did teach before him, in that he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth according to the doctrine of the Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Councell, due honour &amp; veneration is to be giuen to the images of Chriſte &amp; his ſainres in which neuertheleſſe there is no contrarietie at all, but rather great agreement &amp; confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie not onelie in the matter it ſelfe, but euen in their manner of ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>And by theſe two pointes which are the cheife matter of moment which our aduerſarie
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2119:320"/> hath in this ſection, the reader may eaſilie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the reſt; &amp; if beſides this, if he doth but marke how deceitfully he dealeth with Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this ſection about the ſucceſſion of the Popes to S. Peter, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded he will neuer truſt Puritan writer as long as he liues. But note the impoſtors ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tletie, that which Bellarmine ſayth of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable placing of the ſeate of ſainct Peter at Rome by Chriſtes appointment which he affirmes not to be a matter of faith or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable precept of God, this honeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant applies it to the abſolute being of ſainct Peter at Rome &amp; the ſeating of his chaire ther, &amp; then vpon this falſe &amp; detorted vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his doctrine, inferreth as from his owne confeſſion that therefore at the beſt it can be but probable that the Pope should ſucceed Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that Seat, &amp; thre is no neceſſitie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue it, for that Bellarmine ſaith it is no point of faith, &amp; that if Chriſte gaue anie ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, it may be changed, thus the knight. And yet the truth is that in none of thoſe places the Cardinall ſpeaches of the ſucceſſion of the Pope to ſainct Peter, but onelie of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the connexion of the Apoſtolicall ſeate with the particular Roman Church, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one is ſo ſtrictlie ioyned to the other that it cannot be transferred to another place viz. to Antioch where ſainct Peter did fitlie
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2119:321"/> for a time abide, or to ſome other Epiſcopall ſeate of the Catholike Church, which Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine affirmes not to be a point of faith or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable diuine precept: but of the infallibility of the ſucceſſion of the Pope in the ſeate of S.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2119:321"/> ſpoken not of the ſucceſſion, but of the reaſon of the ſucceſſion, of the Pope to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Sainct Peter: for Bellarmine doth expreſſelie diſtinguish in the ſame place ſaying, <hi>aliud eſſe ſucceſsionem aliud ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſucceſsionis:</hi> &amp; the firſte which is the ſucceſſion, he teaches cleerlie to be by the inſtitution of Chriſte, but the manner of the ſame ſucceſſion that is the reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bishop of Rome rather then the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of Antioch or anie other doth ſucceed S. Peter in that Seat hath it beginning from the fact of Peter: But Bellarmine neyther in anie piace of thoſe cited by Sir Humfrey nor in anie other affirmes that the right of ſucceſſion is founded in the fact of Peter: But this was the craft of our ſubtle knight whereby he might inferre that the fact of Peter being no matter of faith, but at the moſt of morall certaintie, the whole frame of the Roman religion might therefore ſeeme to be doubtfull &amp; vncertaine. And to this end he falſelie applied to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion it ſelfe that which by Bellarmine was ſpoken onelie of the manner of the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. From which vniuſt proceeding of Sir Humfrey we may gather by the way, that there is no dealing with theſe people but at hand blowes, I meane by producing of the bookes out of which they make their allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, otherwiſe if they can but ſcape without
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2119:322"/> examen, they will make no ſcruple to couſen their owne Fathers as experience hath alreadie taught vs.</p>
                  <p>To conclude I aſſure the reader that the reſt of the matter in this place is but ſuch loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtuffe as this, mingled with ſo manie impudent vntruthes that I am not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them ſeuerallie: All which becauſe I perceaue the more it is ſtirred the more it ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, I will leaue it to himſelfe to make the beſt he can of it, &amp; if by corruption &amp; fraude he will needes build a by-way for vs Romaniſts, he doth but labore in vayne, ſince that he can no ſooner finish it, but that we can aſſoone returne it vppon himſelfe &amp; fellowes.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Sec. 21.</note> In the next ſection which is the 21. the knight treateth of the Popes iudgment, which he ſaith, is not yet certaine &amp; agreed vpon among the Romaniſts, notwith ſtanding it is by them made the rule of faith.</p>
                  <p>In this ſection I finde nothing meritorious of a ſchollers labour either in reading it or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſering it, for it is but an idle continuation of the authors former fooleries concerming the Popes authority in the determination of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, which on the one ſide he will needes haue it ſo that the Romaniſts hold his iudgment for an infallible rule of faith, &amp; yet he himſelf cites diuers Romaniſts which doe not hold the Popes authority to be infallible,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2119:322"/> which in my opinion is no leſſe then playne dotage. For who is he, if he be not quite depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of iudgment doth not conceiue that if there are Romaniſts which doe not defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Popes authority to be infallible there moſt of neceſſity be alſo ſome, yea &amp; the ſame Romaniſts that hold his iudgment not to be an infallible rule of faith; from whence it doth further neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily iſſue that the infallibitie of the Popes iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in determining Controuerſies is no point of faith among Romaniſts, how be it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly held for the moſt ſafe doctrine, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently as the propoſition of the title of this ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is but a fallacious paradox of the knights owne inuenting, ſo are all the authorities &amp; proofes which he produceth to shewe that there is vncertaintie among the Romaniſts of the Popes infallible iudgment in the rule of faith in vaine &amp; of no force, as tending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that which is not denied by all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike diuines. And thus Sir Humfrey mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth on in the by-way of his owne deuious francies euen to the end of his ſection, neuer omitting to excerciſe himſelf by the way in ſome part of impiety againſt the Popes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping malitiouſly at the euill life of ſome of them in particular: all which how true or falſe it is (yet not doubting but that they haue binne much calumniated by emulators &amp; heretiques &amp; ill aduiſed perſons as by the writers of their

                     <note place="margin">Sec. 22.</note> In the 22. ſection the knight affirmes that the Church vppon which the learned Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts grounde their faith is onely the Pope: but the Church vppon which the vnlearned rely is no other then their parishe preiſtes.</p>
                  <p>It is iuſt ſo, why? becauſe <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> becauſe Sir Humfrey ſayd it. But how doth he knowe it to be ſo? by ſcripture or by tradition? if by ſcripture, let him turne his Bible &amp; produce the text: if by tradition, he is a traytor to his owne cauſe. One ſaid pleſantly, that the faith of a Puritan is reſolued 1. <hi>in Biblia</hi> 2. <hi>in ſpiritum</hi> 3. <hi>in carnem,</hi> firſte into the Bible, ſecondly into the ſpirit, thirdly into the flesh; &amp; heere reſts the laſt reſolution of their religion.</p>
                  <p>But now ſeriouſly to the matter, but indeed there is little matter except by matter we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2119:323"/> corruption, &amp; of this I am certaine there is no want. For to begin with the title of the ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it hath two partes &amp; they both falſe: the one is that the learned Romaniſts ground their faith vppon no other then the Pope; the other that the vnlearned rely vppon no other then their parish preſtes, neyther of which is abſolutely true as experience doth teach. And yet if it were true that the ſimple ſort of people did rely wholy vppon their Parish preiſtes, what then? may not ſimple Romaniſts as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely rely vppon their Parish preiſtes as ſimple reformers vppon their Parish miniſters, who are ſometimes euen as ſimple &amp; ignorant in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity as themſelues, ſetting aſide that perhaps they are a little more expert in reading the text of the Bible in English, or a miſreformed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. And touching the learned Romaniſts they doe not rely vpon the Pope onely, but chiefly vpon the word of God as alſo the moſt ſimple Romaniſts doe thou' not interpred according to ther owne priuate ſenſe as the pretended refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers doe, but expounded according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent &amp; commonly receiued ſenſe of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>To this I adde a moſt odious &amp; ſlanderous lye of the knight where he ſaith of the beleife of the Romaniſts that if it be receiued with an affected ignorance &amp; a blind obedience, <note place="margin">Page 573.</note> the partie shall be ſaued by the fire of Purgatory,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2119:324"/> which is moſt palpably falſe, &amp; neuer aſſerted by any Romaniſt, but coyned by his owne froathie braine, beſides this &amp; the like dishoneſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he abuſeth Bellarmine in diuers places, as lib. 1. de iuſtif. cap. 7. in which place wheras Bellarmine produceth S. Bernards expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe wordes of Iob; <hi>the oxe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did plowe &amp; labore, the aſſes did feed by them,</hi> to proue againſt ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that iuſtifieing faith conſiſts not ſo much in knowledge as in aſſent, ſayeing, <hi>docet Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus,</hi> Bernard teacheth that by the oxen are vnderſtood the learned doctors of the Church, by the aſſes are meant the ignorant, which by their ſimple beleife reſt ſatisfied in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of their ſuperiors: nimble Sir Humfrey applyeing this (thou' very fondly &amp; prepoſterouſly) to the diſprofe of the ignorant peoples relyeing vppon their paſtors in their faith by changing the word <hi>dicit, he ſayth,</hi> (meaning S. Bernard) in to theſe wordes <hi>the Cardinall, ſaith</hi> he makes his reader beleiue that the foreſayd expoſition is Bellarmines owne gloſſe, wheras yet he doth but allege it out of S. Bernard onely to confirme his owne doctrine touching the nature of the forme of iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>Another place the knight corrupts in the ſame Bellarmine lib. 5. de Euchar. cap. 5. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the doctrine of Peter Lombard, &amp; S. Thomas, where the Cardinall affirming that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2119:324"/> they were not carefull of the queſtion now in controuerſie, to wit whether that which the Preiſt celebrateth daily be properly a ſacrifice, but ſuppoſed the affirmatiue part as a thing knowne to all men; the crafty Cauallier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the wordes of Bellarmine ſo tranſuerſly that the reader cannot but vnderſtand by them that the Cardinall affirmes that thoſe two moſt famous diuines cared not whether the Maſſe were a proper ſacrifice or no; but that they did onely content themſelues to hold that it is a commemoratiue ſacrifice onely, as the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers teach. And now let theſe examples ſuffice to demonſtrate the infidelity of our aduerſarie in this ſection: to omit much other impertinent falſe &amp; captious matter &amp; allegations, diuers of which I haue anſered in my cenſure, &amp; are heere ſuperfluouſly repeated by the knight towards the building of this part of his croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; blinde by-way, which as you ſee by the matterialls of it, is ſo fowle &amp; rugged that it is not fit for any perſon of reputation to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere in it.</p>

I for my part am verie ſorrie that the knight hath ſo altered his deſigne in regard I haue long ſince had a vehement deſire to haue a ſight thou' it were onelie <hi>tanquam per ſpeculum in anigmate,</hi> as in a perſpectiue or aſtronomicall glaſſe, of thoſe faire faces which haue lien in lauender ſo manie hundreth yeeres together; yet now I perceiue there is no remedie but patience, &amp; ſo I will leaue thoſe inordinate deſires, &amp; exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how ſoundlie the author proceedes in the impugnation of that which according to his promiſe he ought rather to defend then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to the intent he may ſeeme to haue ſayd ſome thing to the purpoſe, he ſtateth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2119:325"/> the queſtion in another ſenſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that in which it is diſputed betwixt the Romaniſts &amp; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, he putteth the caſe in a conſpicuous &amp; eminent viſibilitie of the Church in all ages perpetuallie: And this viſibilitie I graunt diuers of the teſtimonies which he produceth doe proue not to be neceſſarie to the true Church: Neyther doe I denie that the proofes our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie bringeth, if is ſuppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch a glorious viſibilitie were true, but this is out of the quire, for the queſtion is onelie whither ſuch viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is a certaine note of the true Church as that in all times ſome at the leaſt true profeſſors of it may be aſſigned &amp; named: &amp; this kinde of viſibilitie of the true Church is not diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by all, or anie one of the teſtimonies which are heere alleaged by the knight, but all of them are in vaine produced. But now as he himſelf doth name Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noe, Abraham, Lot, Tobias, Ieremy, Simeon, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Ioſeph, Marie, Elizabeth, to which diuers others might be added in euerie ſeuerall age, I ſay as he could &amp; did name theſe viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the old lawe, ſo doe we demaund of him to shewe &amp; name vs in like manner ſome profeſſors in euery ſeuerall age before the daies of Luther who haue profeſſed the ſame reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in all pointes which is now profeſſed in the pretenſiuely reformed Churches.

And to deale plainlie, till Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey or ſome bodie for him performes this taske, &amp; in this ſenſe, what ſoeuer he or his companions eyther doe or can produce to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the viſibilitie of our Church, we hold it for a meere by-way inuented onelie to auoide that difficultie which abſolutelie in their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding they iudge inſuperable, &amp; impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be cleared.</p>

His anſere is, becauſe it was foretold in the 18. of ſainct Luke, that when the ſonne of man commeth he shall not finde faith vpon the earth: marke the wiſdome of this great Salomon &amp; admire it. S. Luke as his wordes doe plainelie teſtifie, ſpeakes &amp; propheſies of the time of the comming of our Sauiour to iudge the world at the day of the generall iudgment, &amp; yet Sir Humfrey moſt abſurdlie, abuſedlie, &amp; falſelie applyes them to that vaſt Caos or large ſpace of time, which hath paſſed ſince the time of the Apoſtles to the dayes of Luther; yea &amp; as it ſeemes by his diſcourſe euen to the time of Chriſts comming to iudgment in the end of the world: as if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his reformed Logike this were a good conſequence, when the ſonne of man commeth he shall not finde faith vpon the earth, therefore the number of the faithfull is ſo ſmale that at all times they cannot eaſily be diſcerned: ô acute &amp; ſubtile Logician! &amp; in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much fitter for the carte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſchoole of Dialect. Another example I giue the reader in two places cited by the knight, the one out of the 2. of Peter 2. chap. the other out of the 18. of the Reuel. 3. verſe which he applyeth to Indulgences &amp; pardons ſaying in his page 671. how comes it to paſſe that Indulgences &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons are graunted for monie &amp; made the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

Becauſe ſayth he it was foretold there shall be falſe teachers among you by whome the way of truth shall be ill ſpoken of &amp; throu' couetouſnes shall with fayned wordes make marchandiſe of you. Now it is true the place out of ſainct Peter thou' falſelie &amp; fondlie applyed, &amp; might farre more fitly be accommodated to the pretenſiue reformed Puritanicall Nouelliſts whoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of ſchollership si to rayle at the Pope &amp; Roman Church, yet it is not vntrulie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, but in the place quoted out of the Apocalips, there is not one title to this purpoſe, excepting that the Apoſtle once nameth the word merchants; which neuertheleſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true ſenſe of the text, maketh no more to the matter in hand, then if he had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the word miniſter.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of the places of ſcripture which he cites according to the common &amp; current ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Roman Church euen at this preſent, are vnderſtood partly of the precur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Antichriſt which are the heretikes &amp; perſecutors in generall of all ages: &amp; partly of that great Antichriſte properly ſo called, whoſe comming all true Catholikes haue euer expected onely about the end or conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world: howbeit if a man were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in trifles &amp; trickes he might much more commodiouſly applie thoſe ſame places
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2119:328"/> to Luther &amp; his ſequaces, as hauing their pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree &amp; diſcent from ſeuerall heretikes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, then eyther to the Pope or Church of Rome, as may alſo plainly appeere by the 39. articles of the new Creed of England, of which excepting thoſe fewe that agree with the doctrine of the Catholike Church, there is ſcarce any that haue not binne defended by other heretikes ef more ancient ſtanding, as diuers learned Romaniſts haue demonſtrated in their ſeuerall treatiſes. By all which it doth appeere that althou' Sir Humfrey hath vſed no other proofes in this ſection then the pure text of ſcripture, yet hath he made ſo bad vſe of it that all the world may cleerly perceiue that he is entred much further into his by-way then he was before.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2119:330"/> profeſſed your religion in euery point, &amp; in euery age before the daies of Luther. This is the charge you haue vndertaken, &amp; till you haue diſcharged your ſelfe of this, your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſtill remaines at the ſtake, &amp; for all your bragges your ſafe way is to the Romaniſts &amp; all other of mature iudgment, but onely a by-way, &amp; ſerueth onely for a cowardly excuſe of your want of abillitie to performe your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>But now to returne to the contents of this ſection in particular from which I haue in ſome ſort digreſſed. I ſay it conſiſts onely in a recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of thoſe ſeuerall pointes of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie which I haue alreadie examined, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of which ſince the author hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced nothing which I haue not ſufficiently confuted &amp; conuinced to be of no force, but all eyther falſe equiuocall or impertinent, it is moſt apparent that what ſoeuer he from hence collecteth by way of concluſion is noe conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor of any more authority then his owne bare affirmations or negations, &amp; conſequently notobſtanding the vaine knight will needes ſeeme to haue the victorie &amp; to haue gained his cauſe, yet I make no doubt but that the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reader will rather iudge in fauour of the anſerer then of the abiector, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how farre more eaſie a matter it is for any man to impugne the doctrine of another
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2119:330"/> then to defend his owne.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore I ioyne iſſue with myne aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries oppoſing the doctrine of the Roman Church to thoſe ſame poſitions of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reformed Churches which the knight hath heere ſett downe, applying the ſame to the ſafe way &amp; by-way as he hath donne, by-way of antitheſis or oppoſitiue compariſon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt them both in the manner followeing.</p>
                  <p>And firſte I ſay; The Romaniſts teach that not ſcripture onely, but ſcripture with diuine &amp; Apoſtolicall traditions receaued for ſuch by the vniuerſall Church in all ages, the approued generall Councells, &amp; the infallible authority of the perpetually viſible Church of God are the onely certaine meanes &amp; ſafe way to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But Sir Humfrey with his complices teach that ſcripture onely interpreted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe them by authoritie of the moſt vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallie florishing Church according to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual tradition of the Fathers &amp; doctors of the ſame is ſufficient to ſaluation, &amp; this is a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; by way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the Romaniſts teach that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are a moſt certaine a moſt ſafe &amp; perfect rule of faith, yet in ſome places obſcure &amp; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous as euen ſome of their aduerſaryes confeſſe, &amp; therfore it is not ſufficient alone, but requires the authority of the true Church commended in the ſame ſcripture as an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2119:331"/> interpreter; &amp; this is a ſafe way to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but the Reformers teach that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the interpretation &amp; conference of one place with another by euerie priuate man or woman that can but reade it, is a ſure euident &amp; perfect rule of faith, &amp; this is an vncertaine &amp; by-way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Romaniſts teach that tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions appertayning to faith or manners recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Chriſte by his Apoſtles or from the Apoſtles themſelues by inſpiration of the holie Ghoſt, &amp; as ſuch conſerued in the Church by continuall ſucceſſion, are to be imbraced &amp; reuerenced with like pious affection as the ſcriptures; &amp; this is a ſafe way to ſaluation: but the reformers teach that onelie thoſe traditions concerning faith &amp; manners that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by ſcriptures of which ſort they denie anie to be in the Church notobſtanding ſainct Paul in the ſcripture expreſſelie commandeth the Theſſalonians to hold his traditions deliuered vnto them by word of mouth or by epiſtle. And this is an vncertaine &amp; by way.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly the Romaniſts teach that the vniforme conſent of vndoubted Fathers is to be followed in the interpretation of ſcriptures &amp; ſome certaine perſons in the Church as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of diuinitie &amp; ſome others for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of noueltie in doctrine, take an oath of the ſame: &amp; moreouer that where they finde
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2119:331"/> that conſent, they are to receaue it as a certaine rule for the true expounding of the ſcriptures without contradiction or inuention of other new ſenſe or gloſſes, &amp; this is a ſafe way to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: but the reformers teach that the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme conſent of vndoubted Fathers is to be followed onelie ſo farre as according to their priuate ſpirit or iudgment they agree with ſcriptures, which is a captious &amp; deceitfull rule of expounding them: And this is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine &amp; by-way.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly the Romaniſts teach that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Catholike Church is a congregation or companie of people beleiuing &amp; profeſſing the true faith of Chriſte vnder one cheife head our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte &amp; his vicar in earth the Pope or Bishop of Rome as cheife Paſtor &amp; viſible gouernour of the ſame vnder Chriſte, ſayeing with all that the notes whereby the true Church is knowne from all other hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call &amp; ſciſmaticall conuenticles are not onelie &amp; cheiflie exteriour ſplendour, amplitude, &amp; miracles, as our aduerſarie doth deceitfullie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate; but principallie the name Catholike, antiquitie, continuall ſucceſſion &amp;c. And this is a certaine &amp; ſafe way: but the reformers teach the Church is a Congregation of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours &amp; people with out anie certaine &amp; infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible authoritie &amp; aſſigning for markes of the ſame that which is common to all congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2119:332"/> euen of heretikes &amp; ſchiſmatikes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeuerall opinions, as all &amp; euerie one of them holding they haue the true word &amp; Sacraments rightlie preached &amp; admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in their conuenticles, which conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly can be no certaine markes of the true Church in particular, no more then the name of a Chriſtian in generall can be an infallible note of a true beleiuer; &amp; this is an vncertaine &amp; by-way.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly the Romaniſts teach that General Councells by the Popes authoritie or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation conuocated &amp; confirmed are not onelie of great vſe in the Church: But alſo of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; infallible power for the determination of all doubts &amp; controuerſies in religion which may ariſe in ſeuerall times &amp; occaſions, &amp; this is a certaine &amp; ſafe way: But the Reformers teach that General Councells althou' they ſay they be of great vſe &amp; authority in the Church to determine controuerſies in religion, yet they hold them of vncertaine authoritie &amp; ſubiect to errour both in faith &amp; manners, &amp; this is an vncertaine &amp; by-way.</p>
                  <p>Seauenthly; the Romaniſts teach that the cheife rock &amp; angular ſtone vpon which the Church is built is Chriſte the Sauiour of the world, yet they ſay with Chriſte himſelfe that Peter is alſo in his kinde a rock vpon which he promiſed to build his Church, &amp; this is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2119:332"/> &amp; ſafe way: But the reformers teach, that Chriſte alone is the onelie rock vpon which he built his Church which is repugnant to the expreſſe wordes of Chriſte in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſayeing to Peter, <hi>vpon this rocke will I build my Church:</hi> &amp; this is a diuerticle or by-way.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, the Romaniſts teach that the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration &amp; effect of the Sacraments depend chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flie &amp; principallie vpon the inſtitution of Chriſte, yet they ſay withall, that both for the ſecuritie of the conſciences &amp; comfort of the receauers &amp;c. The Preiſt muſt haue a ſincere intention to miniſter, the Sacrament &amp; not in ieaſt as Luther &amp; ſome other ſectaries doe teach &amp; this is a certaine &amp; ſafe way to ſaluation. But the Reformers teach that onelie the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſte is ſufficient, &amp; the Preiſts ſincere intention not required, &amp; this is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine &amp; by-way.</p>
                  <p>Nintly the Romaniſts teach, that Chriſte is our onelie mediatour of redemption, &amp; who onelie of himſelf &amp; by his owne power know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſecrets of our hartes; yet withall they ſay that his Saintes in heauen, who in &amp; by him doe aſſuredlie knowe the ſecrets of our hartes in ſuch things eſpeciallie as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne the good of our ſoules, are our mediatours of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, by offering our vnworthie prayers to God, &amp; this is a certaintie &amp; ſafe way to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2119:333"/> ſaluation: But the reformers calle vpon Chriſte onelie &amp; exclude &amp; neglect his ſaintes &amp; ſeruants whome neuertheleſſe he himſelfe doth promiſe to honore in heauen, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo for impious &amp; ſacrilegions the ſaintes interceſſion for ſinners, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he doth not condemne for ſuch in anie parte of holie ſcripture, &amp; this is an vncertaine &amp; by-way.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly the Romaniſts teach we ought to adore Chriſtes bodie preſent in heauen where he ſits on the right hand of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Father, yet withall they ſay it is lawfull yea &amp; we ought to adore him wherſoeuer he is, &amp; particularlie in the bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt, &amp; this is a certaine &amp; ſafe way to ſaluation: But the reformers teach that the bodie of Chriſte ought not to be adored in the Euchariſt but onelie in heauen, &amp; this is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine &amp; by-way.</p>
                  <p>Eleauenthly the Romaniſts as the word of God inſtructs them, confeſſe themſelues to be vnprofitable ſeruants in regarde neyther they nor their actions bring anie profitte to God who hath no need of anie thing, &amp; yet they ſay withall that no man liuing can be iuſtified by his owne merits, that is ſuch merites as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed purelie from his owne naturall forces &amp; actions, &amp; more then this that all thoſe who expect ſaluation muſt beleiue in Chriſte with a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2119:333"/> liuelie faith &amp; wholely relie vpon his meritts &amp; ſatisfaction as vpon the proper &amp; principall cauſe of their ſaluation; yet they ſay beſides this, that altho' they may not relie vpon their owne merits or the ſatisfactions of the ſaintes alone, neuertheleſſe they may vſe both the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſaintes &amp; their owne merits as a meanes to ſaluation, by virtue &amp; application of the merits &amp; ſatisfaction of Chriſtes paſſion, &amp; alſo that they can by the grace &amp; aſſiſtance of God obſerue his commandements, yea &amp; by virtue of the ſame diuine grace performe ſome workes of ſupererogation or not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by precept of God but counſelled by his aduiſe, &amp; this is a certaine &amp; ſafe way to ſaluation: But the reformers teach they are vnprofitable ſeruants (which I confeſſe that in deed they are both to God &amp; his Church as euer were anie in the world) &amp; that no mans good workes altho' they proceed from the ſpeciall grace of God can in anie ſort iuſtifie him before God, &amp; that euerie Chriſtian muſt ſo wholie relie vpon the merites of Chriſte, that he beleiue alſo that no man can haue anie of his owne euen by the power &amp; grace of God, &amp; that he is bound to expect &amp; hope for ſaluation without anie ſuch workes or merites, meerlie by a ſole &amp; bare faith that his ſinnes are remitted in Ieſus Chriſte, &amp; this is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine &amp; by-way.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:2119:334"/>
                  <p>Heere you ſee a plaine confrontment of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers particular pointes of controuerſie betwixt the Romaniſts &amp; the reformers by way of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation &amp; negation, &amp; becauſe I knowe that my aduerſarie &amp; I are not agreed of a Iudge of our cauſe, I for for my part remit my ſelfe to the indifferent reader as our onelie vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piere to determine of the matter not onelie for as much as concernes the contents of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſection, but alſo of the whole worke, who if he conſider with due ponderation the proceedings of both parties, &amp; compare the ſincere &amp; plaine dealing which I haue vſed with the inſincere and double dealing of my aduerſarie, who hath ſo perſeuered in his indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect courſes that euen in the end &amp; concluſion of his worke he hath practiſed no ſmale par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallitie and fraude in the rehearſall of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Roman Church, as particularlie where he affirmes that the Romaniſts teach that diuers traditions of faith and manners whereof there is no ground nor euidence in the ſcripture are to be reeeaued with equall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and reſpect with the ſcriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and that they relie partelie vpon their owne merites and ſatisfaction of Saintes for their ſaluation and the like. I ſay if the iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and vnpartiall reader duelie ponder all the particulars, I doubt not but he will eaſilie diſcerne the houſe of truth and ſafe way to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2119:334"/> to be where he findes honeſtie and plainenes, and in the contrarie the houſe of falſitie &amp; the by-way where he findes tricks &amp; couſinage. And therfore the more to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate &amp; rectifie his iudgment in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I will reduce the whole argument of the knightes booke to a forme of ſylogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in this manner.</p>
                  <p>That Religion is a by-way leading the weake &amp; vnſtable into dangerous pathes of error which is founded vppon coulou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhowes of Apochriphall ſcriptures, vnwriten traditious, doubt full Fathers am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Councells and pretended Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church.</p>
                  <p>But the religion of the Church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is founded vppon colourable ſhowes of apochriphal ſcriptures, vnwritten tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, doubtful fathers ambiguous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels &amp; pretended Catholique Church.</p>
                  <p>Therfore the relgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church is a by-way leading the weake &amp; vnſtable in to the dangerous pathes of error.</p>
                  <p>Now, the <hi>minor</hi> of this ſylogiſme in which the whole force of the concluſion, and by conſequence the whole ſcope and authoritie of the worke depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hauing binne in the diſcourſe of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeere to euerie ſeuerall ſection diſproued for falſe &amp; counterfeit, but alſoe more

                  <head>A SVPPLIMENT OF ADDITIONS TO THE APPPENDIX.</head>
                  <p>I Haue alreadie noted diuers moſt foule corruptions and falſifications in Sir Humfrey linds pretented ſafe way in ſoe much that I am almoſt quite ſurfeted with the multitude of them, yet in my opinion ther is ſcarce anie amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all thoſe which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes neare to the falſe dealing and couſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage which the ſame Sir Humfrey vſeth in the 205. page of his <hi>Deuia,</hi> which if it were for noe other reaſon, yet for this a lone it might moſt iuſtely deſerue the name, not as it is falſely applyed to the Romaniſts, but as it is his owne proper worke, which if the reader will but pleaſe to haue a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle patience, I will plainely ſet before his eyes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore Sir Humfrey in the place now cyted vndertaking to proue that tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation wants antiquitie, vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie, and ſucceſſion, hauing firſt cited ſome teſtimonies both out of Greeke and Latin authors (which neuertheleſſe are either of noe force for his purpoſe, or els

And in deed I muſt needs confeſſe that this paſſage of his is able to make a greate ſhowe eſpecially bringing a Greeke worde in the mideſt of it.</p>
                  <p>But now when I came to examen the matter in the booke it ſelfe and conferred the Greeke and the Latin togither as I founde it printed at witerberg a place voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of all ſuſcipition on our ſyde, I found firſt that the author ſpeakes ſoe plainely of the reall preſence and tranſſubſtantiation, that altho' he vſeth not the verie ſame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, yet doth he vſe other wordes equiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as, <hi>conuerſion, tranſmutation,</hi> or the lyke, at the leaſt ten or a dozen tymes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely

Nay and more then this, I fynde that where he ſpeakes of the conuerſion or tranſmutation he vſeth that verie worde <hi>Metauallo,</hi> which the knight denyeth him to vſe, where he dini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the change of the bodie and bloud in to humane fleſh, which is a forceble argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a contrario that the Patriarch ſpeakes of a reall change wherſoeuer elſe in this matter he vſeth that worde.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. I fynde that thoſe wordes which Sir Humfrey cytes are not ſpoken by the Grecian Patriarke of the proper tranſmutation in the Sacrament, but of an other tranſmutation which belong onely to the vſe of the Sacrament to wit, he ſayth and that verre truely, that when a faithfull perſon receiues the Sacrament, the bodie and bloud which he receiues are not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in to humane fleſh, but the receiuers in to them. <hi>Non quod haec</hi> (ſaith the Patriarch) <hi>in corpus humanum tranſmutentur ſed nos in illa melioribus his praeualentibus:</hi> and here it is that he vſeth the worde <hi>Metaballomeua</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth it to be verifyed in this kynde of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſpeaking according to that which an ancient Father of the Church ſayth to the ſame purpoſe: <hi>Non tu mutaberis in me, ſed ego mutabor in te.</hi> That is to ſaye. <hi>O lord thou shalt not be changed in to mee, but I in to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2119:338"/> thee.</hi> Which ſpirituall change or vnion the ſame Patriarch doth learnedly proſecute and declare with examples, not intending by that to exclude the reall preſence of Chriſts bodie &amp; bloude in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by tranſſubſtantiation (as Sir Humfrey would willingly perſuade his ſimple reader but ſuppoſing and includeing the ſame as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his paſſages in theſe twoe chapters is moſt apparent, and particularly where he ſayth not farre before, <hi>ac quamdiu panis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitus iacet, nihil niſi panis est repoſitus tantum Deo: postea verus panis fit &amp; reuera tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur, cuius rei ratio &amp; modus nullo ingenio, nullo ore humano explicari poteſt.</hi> And page. 97. <hi>Honorabilia haec dora in ipſum Dominicum tranſmutantur corpus quod haec omnia recepit, ſcilicet quod crucifixum ſit, quod reſurrexit, quod in Caelos aſcendit. Tbe honorable giftes</hi> (he meanes the bread and wine) <hi>ar changed into the lordes bodie it ſelfe &amp;c.</hi> and in the precedent page, <hi>qui operationis ſanctorum my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriorum proprium hoc opus ſtatuunt vt dona (intellige panem &amp; vinum) in diuinum Christi corpus &amp; ſanguinem, tranſmutentur, in finem hunc vt fideles ſanctificentur, peccatorumque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionem, regni haeriditatem, &amp; id genus alia accipere credant, non tales beatos praedicamus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Patriarch ſoe perſpicuouſly that he who either vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des Greeke or Latin
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2119:338"/> yea or Engliſh either, may euidently ſee that the Patriarch is cited by our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie euidently againſt himſelfe, and quite contrarie to his true meaning.</p>
                  <p>Yet was not Sir Humfray content with that, but as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> runing forwarde in mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to his owne confuſion he cites the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me author in his former tenth chapter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to proue out of him that it is not the reall and ſubſtantiall fleſh of Chriſt which is offered but the Sacrament of his fleſh, he tells vs ſayth the knight, that the fleſh of Chriſt which he caried aboute him was not giuen to his Apoſtles to be eaten, nor his bloud to be drunke, neither doth the bodie of our lord deſcend frome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for this were blaſphemie, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des I confeſſe the Patriarke hath (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe: <hi>in the Sacrament:</hi> Which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the text by Sir Humfrey) but as he hath them ſoe hath he others omitted by our aduerſarie the knight both before and after theſe, which clearely declare his myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de touthing the reall preſence. The prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wordes are theſe: <hi>Dominus enim illa no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte accepit panem gratias egit, fregit, &amp; dixit, accipite &amp; comedite. non dixit hoc est azinum, aut typus corporis, ſed hoc eſt corpus meum, hic eſt ſanguis meus:</hi> that is our lord that night tooke bread, gaue thankes, brake it, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2119:339"/> ſaid, take and eate. He ſaid not this is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauined bread, or this is the figure of my bodie, but this is my bodie, this is my bloud. And then immediately enſue the wordes cited by Sir Humfrey, after which alſoe immediately followes: <hi>Sed &amp; tunc, &amp; nunc inuocatione &amp; gratia omnipotentis illius ſacrorum rituum Antiſtitis Spiritus ſancti, ſacrarum precationum &amp; diuinorum oraculoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> interuentum panis quidem in ipſum Domini cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, vinum vero in ipſum Domini ſanguinem conuertitur &amp; tranſmutatur.</hi> But both then and now by inuocation and grace of that omnipotent Prelate of ſacred rities the holie Goſt, by interuention of ſacred pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and diuine oracles, the bread truely is counuerted and changed into Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die it ſelfe, but the wine into to his bloud.</p>
                  <p>In which wordes the learned and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reader can not but ſee both the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preſence and the conuerſion or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of the elements of bread and wine (which is nothing els but tranſſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation) into the bodie and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt moſt plainely ſpecifyed. Which may abundantly ſerue to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the truth of the Patriarkes meaning, and that no man liuing excepting ſuch a lad of mettall as the coragious knight would haue had the face to make vſe or rather

To all which may be added yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wordes of the ſame Patriarke ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus. <hi>Statuit igitur Catholica Eccleſia mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari conſeeratione facta panem quidem in ipſum corpus Chriſti, vinum vero in ipſum ſanguinem eius per ſpiritum ſanctum &amp;c.</hi> The Catholique Church therfore (ſaith he) defins that the conſecration being made the bread is changed into the bodie of Chriſt but the wine into his bloud by the holie Goſt &amp;c.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2119:340"/> and wine in the conſecration of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt which the Romaniſts in Latin call tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation which is ſufficient to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince the prepoſterouſnes of the iniudicious knight in makeing vſe of this great Prelate for his owne contrarie poſition.</p>
                  <p>Touching inuocation of ſaincts and their worſhip Sir Humfrey in the 232. page of his deuious way alledges againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts the confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Greeke Church quoting in the margen the ſame Patriarch of Conſtantinople and relating his wordes in his anſer to the German Doctors cap. 1. Wher according to his relation, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch ſayth in the name of him ſelfe and fellowes, that they doe not properly inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſaints but God, fot neither Peter nor Paule heare anie of thoſe that inuocate them, but the gift and grace that they haue according to the promiſſe: I am with you till the conſummation of the world. Thus the knight rehearſes that authors wordes but yet corruptedly, for firſt the Patriarch hath not thoſe negatiue wordes: <hi>We doe not properly inuocate ſaints,</hi> but this affirmatiue: <hi>inuocation doth proporly agree to God onely,</hi> and it doth agree to him primarily and moſt immediately (which wordes Sir Humfrey leaueth out) but inuocation made to ſaints is not properly inuocation but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2119:340"/> and as if we ſhould ſay by grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor: which latter words alſoe the knight partely mangled and partely omitted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the Patriarch dot not ſaye Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Paule doe not heare their inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors but he ſayth: they doe not <hi>exaudire,</hi> that is they doe not heare and graunt by their owne power the petitions of thoſe that inuocate them. And ther is ſoe much betwixt <hi>audire &amp; exaudire,</hi> that his hearing and graunting that which is heard, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thou' the one vndoubledly agree to the ſaints both in the doctrine of the Grecian Church and the Roman: yet of the exau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or hearing with a graunt, doubt may be made euen according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Roman Church whether it is proper to ſaints or noe, in regarde it may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued that altho' the ſaints be truely interceſſors betweene vs and God, yet haue they not power to graunt out requeſts but onely to mediate for vs by way of impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therfore the ſame author ſaith that Peter and Paule doe not <hi>exaudire</hi> that is, not ſoe heare vs as they them ſelues graunt our petition which they heare but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is according or by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor they haue by virtue of the promiſſe of our Sauior: <hi>I will be with you till the end of the world,</hi> as the Grecian Patriarch doth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2119:341"/> ſufficiently declare. And that the Grecians doe in generall termes graunt inuocation of ſaints (which is that which both agrees with the Roman doctrine and differs from the doctrine of the pretented reformers) it is manifeſt not onely out of this place but alſoe out of other places of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes anſer, as particularly in the 13. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pag 102. wher it is ſaid by him: that in the ſacrifice or maſſe, <hi>mentionem beatiſſimae Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis facimus, laudes eius praedicantes, interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione ſanctorum omnium petentes, miſericordiam Dei implorantes pro viuis mortuiſque ſupplican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes &amp;c.</hi> And yet more plainely in the verie 21. chapter cited by our aduerſarie, where the Patriarke hath theſe wordes. <hi>Haec medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio nunc in Eccleſia fit &amp; depraedicatur, &amp; ad ſanctos exclamamus, &amp; ad dominam nostram &amp; ad ſanctos Angelos: &amp; ad dominam quidem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtram, terſancta domina Deipara pro nobis inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede peccatoribus: ad ſanctos autem Angelos, omnes caelestes poteſtates ſanctorum Angelorum, &amp; Archangelorum orate pro nobis &amp;c. This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is now made &amp; preached in the Church: we both crye aloud to the ſaints and to our ladie, and to the Angels: and to our ladie truly, thriſe holie ladie mother of God intercede for vs ſinners. But to the holie Angeles all you, Celestial. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of holie Angels, and Algels pray for vs &amp;c.</hi> Loe heare the verie ſame forme of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2119:341"/> prayer to ſaints which the Romaniſt vſe: ſoe that the reader may eaſily iudge how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſſy Sir Humfrey hath proceeded in the citation of this auther. And howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it is that the Grecians will not call this proper inuocation of ſaints, yet that is but <hi>questio de nomine,</hi> a queſtion onely aboute the name or worde inuocation, which little importes ſuppoſing that in reallitie and ſubſtance they diſegree not from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, but rather are moſt conformable vnto them euen in the manner of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpellation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And beſydes this if wee</hi> note the Lutherans wordes to the Patriarke, it will euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce manifeſtly appeare what the Grecians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d touching his point. For ſay the Doctors: <hi>Non dubium eſt quin ſit de ſanctis reuerenter ſentiendum, &amp; loquendum &amp;c. non tamen ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus eos eſſe inuocandos vt ſint noſtri mediatores atque iutercedant apud Deum pro nobis qui iam mortui ſunt.</hi> Which wordes of the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans being thoſe which they directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt the doctrine of the Grecians in this particular, it is clearer then the leight of the ſunne that the Grecians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with vs, and be contrarie to the tenets of Sir Humfrey and other ſectaries of our tymes. And thus we ſee that altho' Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey both in this and diuers other places of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2119:342"/> his bookes doth much labore to perſuade the reader that the Grecian Church agrees with the pretented reformers and differ from vs in doctrine of controuerſie, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe his worke wil not fadge, it being manifeſt to them whoe haue viewed the doctrine of their Patriarke in his foreſaid anſer to the lutherans, that excepting the point of the Popes ſupremacie (in which neuertheleſſe the Grecians doe not in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie reſpect agree with them) they doe not fully ioyne with the nouelliſts of our age in anie one of the queſtions in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betwixt vs and them. And ſoe I may conclude that Sir Humfrey not obſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the fraudes and diuiſes he hath v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in laboring to make the Grecians ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to ſtand for his faction, he doth but onely raſe duſte to moleſt and daſle his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders eyes.</p>
                  <p>More ouer the ſame Patriarke page 243. of his anſer to the lutherans doth abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely prnounce that ſaints are to be invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for thus he ſaith. <hi>Ad haec nos ope diuina reſpondemus inuocandos eſſe ſauctos quod ipſi eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am auxiliari peſſint.</hi> And he addeth after war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. <hi>Nec id faciunt ſolum viui ſed etiam mortui.</hi> And a little lower he ſubioyneth. <hi>Inuocatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſanctorum daemones abiguntur, morbi fugan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, tentationes tolluntur &amp;c.</hi> Alſo page 244.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2119:342"/> 
                     <hi>honorandi igitur ſunt ſancti tanquam amici Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like maner touching the images of Saints he further addeth. <hi>A nobis etiam ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginibus ipſorum reuerentium exhiberi, aut adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri nemo reprehendit. &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>none of vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth that reuerence, or adoration be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to their images.</hi> Meaning of the Saincts. And in the page following he ſaith in this manner. <hi>At (inquit aliquis) Deus dixit. Deum tuum adorabis &amp; illi ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li ſeruies: &amp; non facies vllam ſimilitudinem.</hi> He anſereth thus. <hi>Est vero ita; ſunt hoec lege diuina ſancita, verumtamen qui hoc praecipit Deus, idem docet nos in deuteronomio. Non ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabis ipſa, non ſeruies.</hi> And page 254. Soe he ſpeakes. <hi>Vt igitur qui non honorat filium (vt ait dominus) non honorat patrem: ſic qui non honorat imaginem nec illum quem imago refert honorat.</hi> And in the ſame page. <hi>Qui non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorat Crucem, eum nequidem Dominum crucifix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um adorare iuſtum est. Non quidem certe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram ligni &amp;c. Sed memoriam &amp; picturam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſſorum &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally of merit he ſaith thus. <hi>Haec &amp; ſimilia ſunt ob quae homo regno coeleſti dignus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur.</hi> That is <hi>theſe &amp; the like ar theſe thing for which a man is held worthie of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall kingdome,</hi> thus much touching the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2119:343"/> abuſe of the Grecian Patriarke by Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey.</p>
                  <p>But one of the groſſeſt errours that I finde committed by our aduerſarie in the Doctrine of the latiniſts or Romaniſts, is in his page 234. where he hath theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Others (as namely Antiſiodorenſis &amp; Biel) teache that neither the Saints pray for vs, neither are we to praye to them. Thus Sir Humfrey, further adding that he may ſafely conclude theſe and the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conſidered that inuocation of Sains wants antiquitie, vniuerſalitie, &amp; ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>And yet I hauing examined the matter &amp; taken a viewe of the 30. Lection of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel Biel which is the place the knight ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for his hallucination, I finde that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor expreſſely teacheth the affirmatiues of both thoſe negatiues which he falſely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes him and Antiſiodore to maintaine.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore touching the firſt propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Biel in the place cited hath theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des for his concluſion. <hi>Credendum eſt igitur &amp; nullatenus dubitandum ſanctos in patria in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedere nobiſque ſuffragari merito, ac prece, ſiue voto.</hi> And for proofe of the ſame he addeth thus. <hi>Quae veritas authoritate ostenditur &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, authoritate vtriuſque teſtamenti veteris &amp; noui ſimul, &amp; ſanctorum Patrum.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2119:343"/> his concluſion he ſaith: <hi>fuit haereſis quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumdam, nimia temeritate omnem ſanctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum penitus tollere volentium qui nullum ſanctis honorem impendi debere muſſitabant, neque vllas ad eos preces dirigi, nec eorum reliquias venerari. Huius author &amp; haereſiarcha primus fuit Jouinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus &amp;c,</hi> Which wordes altho they doe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declare what this author holdes of the ſecond parte of this point, yet doth he more expreſſely vtter the ſame towardes the end of this lection ſaying: <hi>ex quibus patet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces noſtras ſpemque conſequendae beatitudinis per mediatores ſanctos in Coelo inanes non eſſe ſed ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne à Deo iuſtituto nos ad eorum auxilia confugere debere &amp; debita veneratione eos ſemper implorare.</hi> By all which wordes Biels doctrine is foe plaine for the Romaniſts, &amp; ſoe plaine againſt Sir Humfrey that I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded he either neuer read this author touching this particular, or if he read him, he did not vnderſtand him.</p>
                  <p>And the like I ſay of Antiſiodore whoe being in the ſame place cited, I fynd that he himſelfe teacheth quite contrarie to that which the knight chargeth him with. For wheras he is alledgeth by Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey in the 4. parte of his ſumme lib. 3. q. 6. to reſolue that neither the ſaints doe praye for vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are wee to praye to them: it is true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſiodore relates the opinion of manie whoe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2119:344"/> ſay that neither are wee to praye to the ſaints nor they praye for vs but onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, to wit becauſe we pray God that the merits of his ſaincts may helpe vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce it is conſequent that their merits may helpe vs: Neuertheleſſe for his owne reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the queſtion he puts the contrarie propoſition ſaying. <hi>Concedimus quod oramus Sanctos proprie, &amp; ipſi orant pro nobis proprie, vt cum dicimus ſancte Petre ora pro nobis, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wee graunt</hi> ſaith Antiſiodore <hi>that wee praye to the ſaincts properly, &amp; that they pray for vs properly as when we ſay: Sainct Peter pray for vs.</hi> And now loe here how faithleſſely the knight hath proceeded in his allegation of the teſtimonies of theſe twoe authors, whoe both ſoe plainely conſpire againſt him: &amp; let the reader alſoe conſider how little reaſon our aduerſarie had to conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that inuocation of ſaincts hath neither antiquitie, vniuerſalitie nor ſucceſſion, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that he can conclude no other ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie out of theſe and the like premiſſes then ſuch as proceeds frome his owne forgerie &amp; deceite.</p>
                  <p>And altho' Gabriel cites an opinion of manie others that graunt the Saints doe praye onely improperly for vs by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of their merits, yet doe they not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all prayer to ſaincts, as Sir Humfrey
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2119:344"/> &amp; the reſt of his pretenſiue reformed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe, whoe if they would but graunt the ſame, the Roman Church would not ſoe much complaine of them; neither is the difference of thoſe Romaniſts frome others in the ſubſtance of this queſtion in controuerſie, which is whether the ſaincts intercede &amp; praye for faithfull Chriſtians liuing in this world, &amp; whether we may praye vnto them &amp; inuocate them, in both which partes of doctrine all Romaniſts agree, but theſe diuines mentioned by Biel doe diſſent from the reſt onely aboute the maner of interceſſion which ſaints doe vſe making a queſtion whether they performe that charitable acte by formall prayer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vnto God for vs or by interpoſition of their merits by that meanes to moue his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine maieſtie to graunt our requeſts, which manner of mediation as it is not the cheefe queſtion betwixt our aduerſarie of theſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes &amp; vs, ſoe neither is it an argument of defect of antiquitie, vniuerſalitie, or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in the Roman doctrine, nor anie proofe of the ſame notes to concurre in the tenets of the moderne ſectaries as Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey doth falſely ſuppoſe &amp; proueth not, but onely equiuocateth in the ſtate of the queſtion, or rather by affected ignorance
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2119:345"/> tranſuerſteth the meaning of the foreſaid diuines touching this point taking the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for the ſubſtance of the matter, &amp; ſoe either throu' affected ignorance or plaine malice diludes his reader. To let paſſe that altho' the foreſaid authors doe not graunte that the ſaints vſe anie formall or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per forme of prayer to God for vs, yet doe they not deuie our in vocation vnto them. Nay ſuppoſing these diuines of whoſe doctrine the kinght would faine take hould as if it were contrarie to the vniuerſalitie of the Roman faith: ſuppoſing I ſay as Sir Humfrey him ſelfe relates out of Gabriel they defend the mediation of ſaints by their merits at the leaſt, if he had had is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in readineſſe, he might eaſily haue either inferred that thoſe ſame authors in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner hould that we may inuocate &amp; pray vnto them euen peoperly &amp; formally: or at the leaſt it is plaine he neither ought nor could deduce the non inuocation of ſaints frome the foreſaid mediation, as erroneou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly he doth, &amp; conſequently he greatly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the maintainers of that opinion in that he produceth them againſt the vniuerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, antiquitie, and continuall ſucceſſion of the Roman doctrine in this particular; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they differ not a iot frome other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique diuines in it touching the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2119:345"/> of faith: yea they are ſoe farre from this, that they expreſſely conſent with them both in the doctrine of mediation &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, both which points neuertheleſſe the Nouelliſts doe obſtinately impugne, ſoe that it appeareth as a manifeſt trueth that Sir Humfrey can not poſſible with all his arte &amp; deuiſes ſcrape anie thing out of them for the antiquitie, vniuerſalitie, &amp; ſucceſſion of his pretenſiue reformed congregation, but rather that which doth quite deſtroye it if he had his dyes aboute him to percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue it.</p>

                  <p>Page 152. of the by-way, Canus is cited by Sir Humfrey lib. 3. cap. 3.

                  <p>In his citation of Canus page 399. of his by way, Sir Humfrey puts the obiection as if it were the doctrine of the author whoe propoundeth &amp; anſereth the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in his laſt chapter of the firſt boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, ſharpely reprehending Pighius out of whoſe opinion the obiection is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Canus &amp; reproued.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2119:346"/> Is not in matter of faith &amp; doctrine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſatie to ſaluation, which is that onely which Canus profeſſeth to maintaine in the defenſe of the authoritie of Councels, <hi>Nos enim in dogmate fidei &amp; deeretis ad ſalutem fidelium neceſſarijs Conciliorum authoritatem aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerimus: in rerum gestarum iudicio &amp; ordine non aſſerimus.

                  <p>When Coſterus pag. 44. of his Enchir. prefers traditions before the word of God: he takes tradition as it is writen in carnall tables of the harte by the finger of the holy ſpirit: &amp; on the contrarie he takes the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten worde of God preciſely as it conſiſts in letters &amp; caracters which may periſh or be corrupted by the falſe conſtruction of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, or otherwiſe.

                  <p>And when the ſame coſterus citcd by Sir Humfrey page. 149. of his <hi>Deuia,</hi> in the firſt chapter of his Euchyr. ſaith theſe wordes. <hi>praeſtantia huius ſcripturae &amp;c.</hi> the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of this ſcripture doth ſurpaſſe the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>multis partibus,</hi> in manie reſpects or by manie degrees thoſe ſcriptures which the Apoſtles left vs in partchement, he doth not ſpeake of the vnwritten tradition of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2119:347"/> the Church, but of that ſcripture which (as afterwardes he declareth) <hi>Spiritus ſanctus in cordibus imprimere dignatus est,</hi> that is which the holie ſpirit doth digne or vout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to imprinte in our hartes. Which as he ſpeakes before in the ſame chapter, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the ſpirit of conſent of the Catholike Church in faith, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording doctrine of all faithfull Chriſtians, not of thoſe onely which now liue in the whole world, but thoſe alſoe whoe by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſucceſſion haue propagated the faith of Chriſt from the tyme of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles which is that Scripture which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith 2. cor. 3. is read by all men, and the vnction. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Io.</hi> 2. <hi>docet nos de omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp;c. which teaches vs all things,</hi> which as he further addeth afterwardes hath all truth in it ſelfe and containeth all faith and myſteries of Chriſtian religion, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues all doubtes which may aryſe in matter of faith, and ſoe coſterus compareth not the vnwritten worde with the written pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely but the internall with the externall, which internall ſcripture is iuſtely prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him before the bare written worde or caracter, becauſe as he takes it here it includes the true ſenſe of both the one and the other: by which it appeares that the exceptions which Sir Humfrey takes at
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2119:347"/> this authors wordes ar captious and voyde of reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Vrſpergenſis is produced by Sir Humfrey page 400. of his deuia as a witneſſe that the ſecond councel of Nyce or ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th generall ſynod aſſembled in the yeare 788. was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected in the councell of Francford as vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly voyde and not to be named the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth. And yet hauing examined this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in that author, I fynde he ſpeakes not a worde of the Nycene councell but of a cettaine councell of Conſtantinople which he affirmes to haue ben called the ſeuenth ſynod general by the Emperatrice Irene and her ſonne Conſtantine: his wordes are theſe. <hi>Sinodus etiam qua ante paucos annos in Conſtantinopoli congregata ſub Irene &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantino filio eius ſeptima &amp; vniuerſalis ab ipſis appellata est, vt nec ſeptima nec aliquid diceretur quaſi ſuperuacua ab omnibus (nimirum patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Concilij Francfordienſis) abdicata eſt.</hi> Vrſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perg. pag. 176. in which wordes of what ſoeuer Councell vrpergenſis intended to ſpeake, yet none of them mention the Councell of Nyce as all thoſe whoe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand latin may eaſily perceiue. And if Sir Hunfrey will replye and ſay that tho' that author doth not mention the Nycene Councell in wordes, yet doth he ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly declare his meaning to be of no other
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2119:348"/> Councell then the ſeeond Nycene Synod in regarde he affirmes it to haue ben vnder Irenne and her ſonne, and the ſame which was condemned in the Councell of Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, I anſer that by reaſon this author doth vtter twoe things which ſeeme to implye contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wit that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was aſſembled at Conſtantinople and yet that it is the ſame which was reiected by the Councell of Francford, it euidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that no certaine argument can be drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wordes whatſoeuer his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was, and this is ſufficient to ſhewe that he is cited in vaine by the knight.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I ſay not obſtanding vſpergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis hallucination, and ſuppoſe he did truely meane that the Councell of Nyce concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the adoration of images was repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Synod of Francford, as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authors admit in their diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with the ſectaries of our tymes, yet doth this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auaile our aduerſaries cauſe both in reſpect the Synod of Francford is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the Romaniſts for an authenticall Councell in this particular, as alſoe for that (as ſome opinate) it proceeded vpon falſe information, and perſuaſion that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Synod of Nyce had decreed that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were to be adored with diuine honor, and by this meanes the Fathers and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2119:348"/> ther aſſembled were deceiued and committed an error of fact. Which error neuertheleſſe neither can nor ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice that doctrine which was before eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by an authenticall generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell as was the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Synod conſiſting of a happie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of both the latin &amp; Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Church as of ſune and moone. And the reader may ſee that Sir Humfrey hath both dealt ſome thing inſincere in the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Vſpergenſis, and alſoe hath proceeded prepoſterouſly in that he indeuored to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the authoritie of the greater Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell by the vncertaine proceeding of the leſſe.</p>
                  <p>Page 261. of the ſame <hi>deuia</hi> he detortes the S. Irenaeus wordes contrarie to his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt Apoſtolicall traditions. And yet S. Irenaeus euen in the wordes which are cited by him, ſpeakes onely againſt thoſe who denyed abſolutely that the trueth is deliuered by the Scriptures but onely by tradition, and ſoe made them ſelues or their onwe traditions the rule of faith. Of which number of hererikes ſaith he were Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Marcion, Cerinthus, Baſilides, of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he vttered the wordes cited by Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, as affirming that the truth could not be founde by Scriptures by thoſe whoe were ignorant of traditions for ſay they: the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2119:349"/> truth was not deliuered by writing but by worde of mouth, yet notobſtanding this the ſame Irenaeus afterwardes ſpeakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others whoe doe not denye ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, or rather againſt ſuch as follow ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures onely and reiect traditions receiued from the Apoſtles by ſucceſſion of preiſts and conſerued or obſerued in the Church ſaying that they haue founde the pure truth. (as the pretended reformers nowe commonly babble) of whome he ſaith that <hi>They neither conſent to ſcriptures nor tradition, and against whome</hi> (ſaith the ſaint) <hi>we ought euerie way to reſiſt.</hi> Soe that it is cleare that he diſputes here onely againſt ſuch heretikes as neither yealde to ſcriptures nor traditions, and therfore he putteth for the litle of his chapter in this place <hi>quod ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſcripturis neque traditionibus obſequantur haretici: that heretiques neither obey ſcriptures nor traditions:</hi> both which S. Irenaeus doth expreſſely imbrace.</p>
                  <p>And by this lett the reader iudge how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempeſtiuely the knigh doth produce this teſtimonie againſt thoſe (I meane the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts) who neither reiect the ſcriptures nor approued traditions but like twoe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided companions receiue them both: and let him alſoe conſider whether the doctrine of holye Irenaeus in this place be not farre
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2119:349"/> more contrarie to the tenet of the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded reformers then to the doctrine of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church: whoe make onely ſcriptures expounded according to their owne ſenſe the ſole rule of faith. Eſpecially conſidering that the ſame ancient Father in the next enſuing chapter doth expreſſely receiue A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall traditions ſaying in the verie firſt wordes: <hi>traditionem itaque Apostolicam in toto mundo manifestam in Eccleſia adest perſpice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re omnibus qui vera volunt audire, &amp; habemus annumerare eos qui ab Apoſtolis inſtituti ſunt Epiſcopi in Eccleſijs &amp; ſucceſſores eorum vſque ad nos qui nihil tale docuerunt neque cognouerunt quale ab his deliratur.</hi> By which wordes it is manifeſt that S. Irenaeus doth confute his aduerſaries the heretikes not by ſcripture onely, but alſoe &amp; cheefely by traditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie authoritie of the Biſhops ſucceeding fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the Apoſtles: which is directly oppoſite to the tenets eſpecially of the purer ſorte of nouelliſts whoe neither admitte tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions nor Epiſcopall authoritie but the onely written worde for abſolute and ſole Iudge of all Controuerſies &amp; confutation of hereſies.</p>
                  <p>Caietan in his Commentarie vpon the hiſtorian bookes of the old Teſtament (as I am perſuaded) doth not plainely affirme (neither doth Canus charge him with that error)
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2119:350"/> that the bookes of Machabies are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely Canonicall, as Sir Humfrey alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth but he onely reprehendeth him for vſing a vaine diſtinction of Canonicall ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures as if there were ſome Canonicall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for inſtruction of manners and not for matters of faith: againſt the infirmitie or vnſoundneſſe of which diſtinction Canus vſeth this reprehenſiue concluſion ſaying. <hi>Cum ſub eodem contextu omnes illi libri nullo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto diſcrimine definiantur eſſe Canonici</hi> (ſcilicet Eccleſiaſticus. Sapientia, Tobias, Iudith, Machabaeoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> libri duo, &amp; Baruch) <hi>ridiculum eſt vt partim in vna ſignificatione partim in alia libros Cenonicos habeamus.

                  </p>
                  <p>And preſently after <hi>Id quoniam abſurdum omnino eſt, retineamus potius eam rationem opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet quam Caietanus voluit evertere vir (vt ſaepe iam dixi) cum primis eruditus &amp; pius, ſed qui in libris Canonicis conſtituendis Eraſmi nouitates ingeniumque ſecutus, dum alienis veſtigijs voluit inſiſtere propriam gloriam maculauit.</hi> And ſoe you ſee Canus doth not confeſſe that dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly Caietan maintained the Machabies not to be Canonicall but onely with that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction: neither did in deed Caietan more denye the authoritie of thoſe bookes then
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2119:350"/> he did the Epiſtle to the Haebrewes, &amp; that of S. Iames which neuertheleſſe he held ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely for Canonicall tho' not perhaps in the ſame rigorous ſenſe in which he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all the reſt of the bookes of ſcripture to be in the Canon, by reaſon thoſe, as alſoe ſome other partes of ſcripture, haue ben by ſome ancient authors doubted of, in which doubt onely he ſeemeth to founde his diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Canonicall bookes of the olde Teſtament Sir Humfrey doth moſt falſely alledge the authoritie of S. Iſidore perſuading his reader that he reiecteth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſame bookes which he and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the newe religion condemne for Apochripha. Weras in deed that ancient author numbereth them all in the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Canon. And to the end the knights impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie may more plainely appeare I will rehearſe S. Iſidores expreſſe wordes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame whoe in his 6. booke of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes or etymologies ſaith thus. <hi>Quartus est apud nos ordo veteris Testamenti eorum librorum qui in Canone Haebreo non ſunt: quorum primus ſapientiae liber eſt.

Nay more then this out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction which he maketh betweene the the Hebrewes &amp; vs Chriſtians in receiuing the foreſaid bookes for Canonicall, I frame a firme coniecture that either all or moſt of theſe ancient authors whoe ſeeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exclude them out of the Canon, doe onely intend to declare that they were not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it by the Iewes as S.

                  <p>More ouer Sir Humfrey cites Gretzerus but onely twiſe: firſt in his defenſe of the tenth chapter of the third booke of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin <hi>de verbo Dei pag.</hi> 15.

                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place he abuſeth that author in that he produceth him to proue that the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2119:352"/> Church is finally reſolued in to the Pope as head &amp; bodie of the ſame. And yet in the verie ſame chapter page 1456. &amp; next lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe Gretzer plainely teacheth that our faith is laſtely reſolued in to diuine reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or in to God reueiling or that which is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in to the prime veritie in which our faith is founded. His wordes are theſe in latin. <hi>Nam ſides noſtra vltima reſoluitur in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelationem diuinam ſeu in Deum reuelantem ſeu quod idem eſt in primam veritatem qua &amp; niti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur fides nostra tanquam fundamento paimario tametſi non inficior fidem quoque reſolui in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam ſeu Eccleſiae propoſitionem, altho I doe nor denye that faith is reſolued in to the Church, or the propoſition of the Church: &amp;c.</hi> Immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely after this he ſaith. <hi>Sed haec reſolutio non eſt omniuo vltima &amp; in principium plane ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiale &amp; eſſentiale: ſed tantum vt in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ſecundarium ſeu vt in conditionem ſine qua fides neque recipitur neque retinetur.</hi> And euen in theſe wordes by the knight, the Pope alone is not put by Gretzerus for the whole Church, but he doth onely ſay, he denyeth not that the Romaniſts vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the Pope the Church in one acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, not abſolutely. Which is manifeſt out of his wordes in the precedent page where he ſaith: <hi>Intelligimus etiam nomine Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae Pontificem pro tempore viuentem quod ipſe
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2119:353"/> congregare &amp; conuocare potest Concilium, &amp; hunc ſummi Pastoris &amp; aliorum Praeſulum cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum dicimus eſſe immediatum &amp; ordinarium &amp; viſibilem omnium Controuerſiarum quae de reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione exiſtunt Iudicem.</hi> By which wordes it is apparent that Gretzerus doth not take the Popes perſon alone for the head &amp; bodie of the Church, but for the head of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Church. How be it I doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye but that the Pope as head &amp; cheefe parte of the whole Church may by a ſenec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche be taken for the whole Church as he is accepted both by Gretzer and other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, but yet this acception will nothing profit Sir Humfrey whoſe wiſe deſigne in this place is to perſuade his ſimple reader that the Romaniſts take the Pope alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne without a generall Councell truely and properly for the whole Roman &amp; Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church which is his owne phamtaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call dreame, not our doctrine.</p>
                  <p>In the other place Sir Humfrey plainely falſifyeth this author, for wheras Gretze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus onely redargueth his aduerſaries whoe falſely affirmes that what ſoeuer the deuill ſuggeſteth to this or that Pope in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar euen againſt manifeſt ſcripture, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts receiue it for Gods worde, ſaying, that theſe things be <hi>crepitacula nugantium Praedicantium,</hi> the clappers of prating prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2119:353"/> &amp; that in truth wee Romaniſts one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue &amp; reuerence for the worde of God that which the cheefe Biſhop doth by Cathedrall definition propoſe vnto vs as the ſupreme maſter &amp; Iudge of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: Sir Humfrey by fraudulent diſplaceing of the worde <hi>onely</hi> &amp; putting it before <hi>the worde of God,</hi> quyte peruertes the ſenſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his reader beleaue that Gretzer affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that onely to be the worde of God which the Pope propoſeth, and as if they held not the ſcripture it ſelfe to be Gods worde; the contrarie of which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Ieſuit deliuers immediately before in expreſſe termes ſaying that, it (meaning the ſcripture) is had &amp; reuerenced by the Pontificians for the worde of God which is ſoe well knowne that the impudencie of the Predicants can not denye it. And thus much touching the corruption &amp; abuſe of Gretzere by the calumnious knight.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer wheras Sir Humfrey cites Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro in his 12. booke as affirming the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of Purgatorie to be a moſt notorious &amp; knowne error of the Grecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; Armenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that author is abuſed by him, for he meanes onely of the moderne Grecians not of the ancient Grecian Fathers, as the knight gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues his reader to vnderſtand, falſely apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Canus wordes page 181. to the Greek
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2119:354"/> Church of the firſt ages, ſoe that here is plaine forgerie.</p>
                  <p>In like faſhion in his 536. page of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia,</hi> he falſifyes the ſame author lib. 1. cap. 9. For where Caſtro ſaith: <hi>quamuis enim tenea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur ex fide credere verum Petri ſucceſſorem eſſe ſupremum totius Eccleſiae paſtorem,</hi> for thoſe wordes <hi>quamuis teneamur</hi> that is, <hi>altho' we are bound,</hi> Sir Humfrey tranſlates, admit we are bounde to beleeue that point, as if Caſtro had doubted of it, of which neuertheleſſe he makes not anie queſtion, but onely ſaith, men are not obledged to beleeue by faith that this or that particular perſon is true Pope. Neither yet doth he denye that euerie Pope hath infallibilitie in a reight line of ſucceſſion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Peter as the knight doth falſely taxe him: but he affirmes onely that it is not a matter of faith ſoe to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of euerie Pope in particular. And therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he addeth that altho' he were not to be accounted an heretike that ſhould denye obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto this or that particular Pope, to wit Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or Leo, yet ſhould he not for doubt of his election ſuſtract him ſelfe from his obedience. And ſoe we ſee that here his no other argument then of want of honeſt dealing in our aduerſarie.</p>
                  <p>And yet in his 21. ſection of the <hi>deuia</hi> page 551. he traduceth the ſame Alfonſus
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2119:354"/> as if he had ſcoffed at the Dominicans in generall for that thay were wonte to brag before the people that he that hath once receiued their habit can not erre or fayle in fairh. Wher it is true that Caſtro repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends ſharpely, &amp; not without reason, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me particular religious men that vſed ſuch ſpeeches, but he is ſoe farre from ſaying they are Dominicans, that he expreſſely addes that leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to taxe the whole order he purpoſely conceiled the name. <hi>Ne hoc toti ordini ac ſocietati impreſſiſſe videar nomen ordinis ex industria ſubticui.</hi> &amp; this he did of Charitie. But Sir Humfrey contrarily is ſoe farre from the exerciſe of that great virtue that he will needs make Caſtro to impoſe that vpon a whole order which he meant onely of ſome particular perſon of perſons. Which is a trick of a iuggler thou' a verie pore one. Neither can I conceiue, except it were by reuelation, howe Sir Humfrey came to know that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro ſpake of the Dominicans more then of anie other religious order, but let that paſſe for one of his great miracles.</p>

                  <p>The knigh moreouer traduceth Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min in the preface to his booke de Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Pont. tranſlating in euerie place for <hi>Graeci, the Greeke Fathers,</hi> as if the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall did confeſſe that the ancient and moſt famous Greeke Fathers to wit S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, S. Baſil Epiphanius and others did impugne and reſiſte the ſupremacie of the Biſhop of Romane. Wheras it is plaine Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin meaneth onely ſuch Grecians as ſate in the Councell of Calcedon whoe frandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently defined in abſence of the Popes lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that the Patriarch of Conſtantinople is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2119:355"/> ſoe the ſecond after the Roman Biſhop as that yet he hath equall priuiledges, whence Sir Humfrey will needs inferre that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of the Pope wantes ſucceſſion: as if the Popes reſiſtance to this attempte of vſurpation in thoſe Grecians were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to exſtinguiſh a true and eſtbliſhed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of all former tymes.</p>
                  <p>In his page 104. of the deuia touching Salmeron the knight falſely affirmes out of chamier that he ſpeakes in the perſon of the Grecians when he vttereth thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. <hi>For as much as the benedictton of the lord is not fuperfluous &amp;c.</hi> For Salmeron neither mentions Grecians nor Latiniſts but onely argues for the ſecond opinion which he putteth of thoſe which ſeeme to hould that Chriſt did not conſecrate his bodie and bloud with thoſe wordes. <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> But whoſe ſoeuer thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des bee the matter is not great, yet certaine it is that Sir Humfrey dealeth falſely and deceitfully in that he produceth them and Salmeron to proue that the grand point of tranſſubſtantiation (as he pleaſeth to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it) hath neither foundation in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor certaintie in the Fathers, nor v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie among the Romaniſts whenas neither thoſe wordes of Salmeron are ſpoken to proue that the grand point of tranſſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2119:356"/> (as he pleaſeth to terme it) hath neither foundation in the ſcriptures, nor certaintie in the Fathers, nor vnitie among the Romaniſts. When as neither thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Salmeron are ſpoken to anie other end but onely to confirme the opinion of ſuch as hould that out Sauior did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate with thoſe wordes: <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> Howbeit, both he and they agree moſt vniformely in that how ſoeuer Chriſt him ſelfe did whoſe power being infinite was not tyed to anie wordes at all for the effecting that which he intended no more then he was in the operation of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles &amp; particularly in the miraculous tranſſubſtantiation of water in to wine in the mariage feaſt of Cana: yet Preiſts whoe are but his ſubſtitutes or inſtruments in that ſacred action doe vndoubtedly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate with thoſe determinate wordes: <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> in which all Romaniſts yea &amp; Grecians (excepting ſome moderne Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians whoe adde ſome other deprecatorie wordes) doe conſent &amp; vnanimouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde. Wher vpon Salmeron before he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to rehearſe opinions touching that point whether Chriſt him ſelfe did conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate with theſe formall wordes, ſaith plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely. <hi>Illud igitur tanquam certum &amp; constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est apud omnes hanc fuiſſe nobis formam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrationis
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2119:356"/> praeſcriptam, &amp; iure diuino inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam ac nobis traditam.</hi> Which wordes ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare that there is no incertaintie among the Romaniſts aboute the foreſaid wordes of conſecration: Nay &amp; if ther were that incertaintie among diuines aboute the forme of the Euchariſt which Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey pretendeth, yet doth it not follow that the Doctrine of tranſſubſtantiation is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine ſuppoſing that both Salmero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; all the ſame diuines agree that the bread and wine are truely tranſſubſtantiated or turned in to the bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently this author is impertinently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as hauing nothing for the knights purpoſe. Beſydes that parte of the wordes which he cites out of Salmeron whether they be the Grecians or not, they include clearely the doctrine of tranſſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit thoſe in particular, <hi>when he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue it tranſmutation was alreadie made:</hi> &amp; ſoe the vnwarie knight hath alledge this paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge againſt him ſelfe. For if the change of the bread &amp; wine was made before Chriſt gaue the Sacrament to his diſciples, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts haue their deſire &amp; intent, that Chriſt did truely tranſſubſtantiate the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it importing little to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by what meanes he performed his action.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:2119:357"/>
                  <p>Page 547. of his <hi>deuia</hi> the kinght cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts Salmeron by a mangled relation &amp; falſe conſtruction of his wordes which he produceth to proue that ſome Romaniſts &amp; particularly Salmeron hould the Popes iudgement infallible. But how ſoeuer it be that ſome Roman diuines hould the Popes authoritie euen without a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell infallible in determining controuerſies in matters of faith, &amp; others the contrarie which as Bellarmin noteth is no matter of faith. Yet certaine it is that Salmeron is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re abuſed by Sir Humfrey for that in this place cited (what ſoeuer he doth in others) he rather attributes all infallibilitie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing &amp; declaring matters of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, cheefely to the aſſiſtance &amp; power of the holy ſpirit, then either to the Pope or Church. His wordes are theſe. <hi>Neque haec ſunt ſatis niſi accedat vnctio &amp; eruditio Spiritus Sancti quem Dominus manſurum nobiſcum in aeternum, qui &amp; in generalibus ſynodis, &amp; in Chriſti Vicario &amp; Petri ſucceſſore reſidens omnes incidentes quaeſtiones &amp; ortas de fide controner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias ſua authoritate terminet atque abſoluat.

                  <p>S. Iſidor Peluſiota writ the Epiſtle cited by Sir Humfrey page 630. to a monke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Zenon, complaining vnto him of want of virtue &amp; corruption of maners in the Church in compariſon of the primatiue tymes, all which that holy man affirmes to proceed from diſſention &amp; wickedneſſe or malice of theſe whoe gouerne eſpecially of preiſts thou' not of all: but he hath not a worde of the Pope, or of anie defect, or of the latencie or inuiſibilitie of the Church which our aduerſarie profeſſeth to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in that his ſection.</p>
                  <p>And this which I ſay is made plaine by the laſt clauſe or concluſion of the epiſtle which is this. <hi>At tu ò conſpicue Eccleſiae alum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ne ad eos qui naufragio pereunt animum at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendas nec cum ſegnibus &amp; ignauis teipſum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares: verum ſcientiae lumen ſplendidius, ſubinde

Nor is ther anie worde which fauors lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded reformation of the Church. Neuertheleſſe if Sir Humfrey and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates could but pick vs out one halfe dozen of ſuch chaſte and religious monkes as theſe, out of all the ſeuerall Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their illuminate brothers ſince the dayes of Luther, then would we moſt willingly giue licence vnto them to reforme the Church at their pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>Sir Humfrey in the 24. chapter of his <hi>deuia</hi> cites a great number of Romaniſts with intention to proue the inuiſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church: &amp; the <hi>medium</hi> he vſeth for his proofe be the teſtimonies of thoſe authors whoe acknowledge abuſes to haue ben in the Church in their ſeuerall ages euen till the dayes of luther: &amp; whoe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye in their writings that they haue deſired reformation of ſuch abuſes. Out of which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2119:358"/> holting premiſſes Sir Humfrey inferreth this crooked concluſion to wit that Luther was the man that made the ſoe long wiſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Which illation as the reader may eaſily perceiue is as lame as her pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, neithet is that conſequens anie more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie then that Mahomet was the reformer of the Church becauſe at the ſame tyme and before he founded his ſect ther were perhaps ſome things which wanted ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And yet much leſſe can anie man imagin how out of thoſe twoe propoſitions viz that diuers learned and pious people complained of abuſes and corruption of maners and deſired redreſſe, therfore the Church was latent and obſcure or inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or yet further that that latent and obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Church was the Church of the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded reformers, or that thoſe zelous and godly perſons who ſoe complained in ſeuerall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, were members of the ſame, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther virtuous and religious Romaniſts as in deed they were, all which inferences becauſe Sir Humfrey neither doth nor can poſſible proue to be ſounde and legitimate, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath ſpent much tyme in vaine in that he maketh a large rehearſall of the ſpeeches of ſuch authors as haue noted the common and publike vices of their dayes, which and the like ſinnes and abuſes no
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2119:359"/> Romaniſt euer denyed but they may be euen in the members of tre true viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>Now to come to particulars to the end the follie of our aduerſarie may more plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely appeare I will examen ſome paſſages which he citeth out of Gerſon which being thoſe which ſeeme moſt plauſible for his cauſe when the reader ſhall ſee them decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and rectifyed, he will without anie more exacte diſcuſſion be able to iudge of others of leſſe apparence and color.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe that Gerſon was free in his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches as being a zelous and plaine man, and a ſharpe repreſender of vices, neuertheleſſe I finde not in his writings but that he was an humble acknowledger of the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie yea and an earneſt defender of thoſe points of doctrine which luther and the reſt of the pretended newe reformants hould for errneous and falſe opinions, for ſuperſtions and idolatrie.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2119:359"/> in the practiſe of the ſame, ſoe might he alſoe wiſh for amendment of them, but this is not contrarie to the doctrine and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze of the Romaniſts but moſt conformable to the ſame, whoe as they confeſſe that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me things deſeruing correction may creepe in to the particular members of the Church yea and into the head and cheefe paſtor him ſelfe, ſoe doe they not onely deſire but alſoe procure reformation of the ſame by all direct and lawfull meanes. And ſoe whatſoeuer Gerſon ſaith in this nature if it be not detorted to a ſenſe contrarie to the true meaning of the author (as here it is by Sir Humfrey) the Romaniſts moſt willingly imbrace it as profitable to the ſoules of manie and for the good of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall Church.</p>
                  <p>It is true Gerſon ſpeakes ſomething har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhely and by exceſſe when he ſaith: euen as wee ſee in like manner in ſome countryes touching cenſures and lawes inuented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute particular obſeruances or rules not neceſſarie to ſaluation which are often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes preferred before the lawes of God and of the Goſpell, And this ſame wee ſee mâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtely in the decrees and decretalls. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce it is that ſome tymes a monke is more ſeuerely puniſhed for going without his hood then for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting adultring or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2119:360"/> and he that offendes againſt one of the Popes commandements then he that ſinnes againſt one of the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, and the Euangell, according to that reprehenſion of our Sauior: you haue fruſtrated the commaundements of God for the traditions of men.</p>
                  <p>In an other place the ſame Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon complaines of the abuſes and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of fryers, Nunns, and preiſts of the great varietie of images which he bids the reader conſider whether they be not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of idolatrie in the ſimple people: of the canonization of newe ſaints and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious orders, of which he ſaith ther are to manie alreadie, and that the feaſts of the newe ſaints are more religiouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued then the feaſts of the Apoſtles, of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrypſall Scriptures and prayers, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious opinions of obtaining remiſſion of ſinnes by ſaying ſoe manie Pater noſters in ſuch a Church before ſuch an image. And in his treatiſe de Concil. Gen. <hi>vnius obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae</hi> he ſaith thus: if the Church may not be reformed according to the ſtate in which it was in the tyme of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, yet at leaſt it ſhould be brough to the ſtate it was in the tyme of Pope ſylueſter.</p>
                  <p>In an other place Gerſon as it were by way of complainte ſaith <hi>in hac tempeſtate</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:2119:360"/> (meaning in that ſeaſon in which he liued) he did ſee, matters ſtanding as they did, that ſcarce anie due determination or ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and free execution of iuſtice was found in doctrine appertaining to faith, religion, to good and hoalſome manners, vnleſſe it were by ſtrong fauor of the ſecular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</p>
                  <p>This is that in ſubſtance which Sir Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>frey alledgeth out of Gerſon yea an ſomething more then he him ſelf produceth: And yet neuertheleſſe as the reader may eaſily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand there is nothing agreeable to the reformation of Luther and Caluin. For Gerſon onely reprehends, and that iuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome particular perſons in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular countryes and in ſome particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations, which ſoe exactely and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly obſerue theit rules &amp; lawes &amp; ſoe ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>orbitantly eſtreeme of them that they often tymes by indiſcreet zeale are more diligent in performing them then they are in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the lawes of God, and that they ſome tymes puniſh more ſeuerely a religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offending againſt one of thoſe mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall rules or ſtatutes, or againſt one of the Popes preceps, or lawes of the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, or others, then they puniſh him whoe committeth adulterie or ſacrilege. Wher as thoſe twoe falſe reformers Martin and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2119:361"/> Iohn were not content with this, and to procure a reformation in ſome particular perſons, rules, and ſtatues, but they too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke away all monaſticall obſeruations ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vowe, rule, or conſtitution, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingniſſed all Eccleſiaſticall lawes both of the Pope and Church as much as lay in their power violating, euerting, and razing the verie buildings of religious houſes and conſuming by fyre the bookes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals and whole Canon lawes, quyte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying that and much more by rage and furie which Gerſon out of a pious &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian zeale onely wiſhed to haue amended.</p>
                  <p>Gerſon complained of the euill life of fryres and nunnes with deſire to haue them reformed and reduced to the obſeruation of their ancient rules and conſtitutions, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely excepting againſt the multiplicie and varietie of religious orders: <note place="margin">

                  <p>Gerſon complaines that Cathedrall Churches are made dennes of theeues, and conſecrated monaſteries markets &amp; Innes: But by the followers of Luther and Caluin, thoſe holie cloyſters are not onely made markets and Innes, but euen ſtables and hogſtyes, &amp; Cathedrall Churches as it were common burſes or exchanges for relation of newes and negotiations, in which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fould iniuſtices and illicit contracts are plotted and accorded to the great profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the houſe of God ordained for onely prayer, ſeruice, and Sacrifyce, ſoe that if Gerſon were now aliue doubtleſſe he would rather taxe the pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers in this nature then thoſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique profaners of his owne tymes.</p>
                  <p>Gerſon bids inquirie to be made if ther be not Apocryphall Scriptures, and prayers introduced in the Church to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of Chriſtian faith, not meaning of anie Scriptures or prayers approued for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, and pious by the authoritie of the Roman Church as are the bookes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibies,

                  <p>And now by this breefe collation or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſion which I haue made the reader may plainely viewe the great difference ther is betweene the deſired reformation of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and that of the pretended Innouators of our tymes, the one being almoſt quite oppoſite to the other: the one intending onely to redreſſe the Church in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acceſſorie defects, the other indeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to deſtroye the whole frame and foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the viſible Church and to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2119:363"/> build a newe one: and finaly the one being a reformation either wholely or cheefly in the life and maners of ſome corrupted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the other cheefly in faith &amp; doctrine and not regarding reformation of life but rather giuing more ſcope and libertie to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe then euer was heard of in the Chriſtian world.</p>
                  <p>And altho' Gerſon doth inſinuate the neceſſitie of reformation euen in matters of faith and religion, yet doth he not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane of the faith and teligion maintained approued and practized by the Roman Church, but he ſpeaketh onely of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of heretikes &amp; ſome abuſes of other particular perſons cropen into the exerciſe of the true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in which he deſired refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the end the ſtate of the Church may remaine and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue firme in her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer puritie without ſtaine of erroneous doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine or corrupted manners. In all which he wiſhed the ſlowneſſe of the prelates might be haſtened by the power of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular authoritie of kings and Princes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then lye vnamended, with danger of the Roman faith and preiudice to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of ſoules. Which pious zeale of that renowned chanceler was highly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as farre different from the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the authors of our newe pretended
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2119:364"/> reformation who to acquire them ſelues a name of famous men vnder the colour of reforming the Church made a preye of the ſame with infinit loſſe of Chriſtian ſoules and generall domage to virtue and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life.</p>
                  <p>More ouer I am to aduertice the reader that in the citation of this author Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mirted twoe notable fraudes. The firſt is in that he reherſes a great parte of his wordes as if he had founde them allogether &amp; in one continuated order or text, wheras the author hath them in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places &amp; to diuers purpoſes. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample Sir Humfrey ioyneth that which Gerſon ſaith of remiſſion of ſinnes by ſo mainie <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> which he hath in his treatie of Indulgences, with that other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of preferring the particular obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome countries before the lawe of God, which he hath not in the ſame place, but in an other treatiſe intituled <hi>de directio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne cordis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly I finde thoſe wordes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which all or moſt of them being ſpoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him onely of correction of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the kinght applyeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to matters of faith to perſuade his reader that ther were corruptions in the Church euen in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, and that the chancelor procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2119:364"/> reformation of them. An exemple of this fraude you haue in the 650. page of the <hi>deuia,</hi> where the knight ſayth Gerso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wiſhed at the leaſt a reſtoring of the ancient faith of the Fathers tyme citing for this his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice intituled, <hi>de Coucilio Generali vnius obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiae,</hi> and quoting theſe wordes in the margin. <hi>Eccleſia ſinon ad ſtatum Christi &amp; Apoſtolorum Saltem ad statum Sylueſtri reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda.</hi> Which wordes neuertheleſſe Gerſon ſpeaketh not of matters of faith, but onely of the prouiſion and collation of benefices as both his whole diſcourſe and eſpecially his precedent wordes doe moſt clearely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.

For as he who eypreſſely graunteth, or aſſents to anie general Principle or propoſition, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that all Angels ar incorporall, or wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout bodies, or that all men ar reaſonable creatures, doth by neceſſarie conſequens aſſent implicitly to all the particulars there included, viz, that S.

                  <p>By occaſion of this I deſire the reader to take yet more cleare notice of the great per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſitie of the propoſterous Nouelliſts, who as they reueile their viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the foreſaid receiued doctrine of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit or inexpreſſed faith, ſoe likewiſe they ar no leſſe peremptorie in defending their owne newe diſtinction of fundamental and not fundamental points in Religion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which their poſition they obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely maintaine the Church can erre in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, that is in ſuch points of faith

                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:2119:375"/>
                  <p>Neither is it auaileable for our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to ſaye that the Church can not erre in the cheefe articles of her faith, as ar the Trinitie, the Incarnation of Chriſt, which ar fundamentals: but in ſuch points as ar not fundamental, as ar the reall preſence, iuſtification, the true quantitie, &amp; ſenſe of Canonical ſcriptures, &amp; other ſuch like matters in controuerſie with vs &amp; them, the Church may teache erroneous &amp; falſe doctrine.</p>
                  <p>For thir euaſion I replie it is grounded not in inuincible, but in vincible &amp; groſſe ignorance of the nature of true faith which being in it ſelfe one ſimple, or ſingle entitie or eſſence as according to the doctrine of the Apoſtle, God &amp; Baptiſme ar. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na fides, vnum Baptiſma, vnus Deus;</hi> how different ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer its obiect be, it is euer eſſentially one &amp; the ſame in it ſelfe cleare from diſtinction, &amp; cleare from error, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to which neuertheleſſe ſhould neceſſarily be true if ei-faith were diuided in to fundamental &amp; not fundamental faith, &amp; the Church could erre in her propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the one &amp; not of the other. And to this I adde that one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the true Church is holines: but now what ſanctitie, integritie, or holines can poſſible be in the Church if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with errors in faith of what nature ſoe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2119:375"/> euer they bee. For as the ſcripture affiir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, <hi>ſine fide</hi> (that is true, pure, &amp; intyre faith) <hi>impoſſibile eſt placere Deo.</hi> True faith is the forme, faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; beautie of the Church which is the immaculate ſponſe of Chriſt' not hauing ſpot or wrincle. In ſoe much that if ſhe be defaced thus with errors ſhe can not poſſible be the ſponſe of Chriſt as in the cided place, &amp; like wiſe in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſhe is deſcribed, all faire, or comely, but rather ſhe would be like a leaper, or moſt deformed creature.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I confeſſe for my parte I could neuer perfectly vnderſtand what the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelliſts truely meane by fundamental &amp; not fundamental points, by reaſon I finde the matter in none of their workes ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explicated, &amp; I veriely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue they purpoſely anoyde the declaration of it, to the ende the abſurditie may leſſe appeare. Neuertheleſſe it ſeemes in probabilitie that by fundamentals they meane all thoſe points which according to their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ar contained in ſcriptures, &amp; the three creedes. And by not fundamentals the points of controuerſie betwixt vs &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as is the number of Canonical bookes, the infallible rule of interpretation of ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, the real preſence, tranſſubſtantiation, iuſtification' &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:2119:376"/>
                  <p>This bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuppoſed I argue thus. Either thoſe points which our aduerſaries call not fundamentals, ar matters of faith' &amp; to be beleeued by all ſortes of Chriſtians accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diuerſitie of their tenets, vnder paine of damnation, or not to be beleeued. If they ar thus neceſſarily to be beleeued by faith, then doubteleſſe they ar included in thoſe truthes touching which, (as I haue declared &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed before by both ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures &amp; Fathers) Chriſt promiſed to his Church the aſſiſtance of the diuine Sprit to remaine with it eternally that is till the conſummation of the worlde, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Church can not committe anie error in propoſing them to the people as being no leſſe fundamental in that reſpect then anie of the reſt of the articles of faith.</p>
                  <p>But if our aduerſaries on the contrarie denye them to be neceſſarily beleeued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of loſſe of Saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; hould the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely as matters of indifferencie, &amp; ſuch as may either be beleeued or not be beleeued without preiudice of faith: or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners vpon this ſuppoſition I graunte the Church may erre in propoſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to her flock, but yet in this caſe that parte of our aduerſaries di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirming that the Church can erre in not fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal matters of faith is ſtill fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in regarde thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2119:376"/> aboue telated in which they teache the Church can erre, ar ſoe farre from being either fundamentals or not fundamentals in matter of faith, that according to the former ſuppoſition they ar not either one way or other with in the circuit of faith: and conſequently that parte or member of our aduerſaries dinſtinction viz that the Church can erre in not fundamentals is both falſe, nugatorie, and impertinent in which ſenſe ſoeuer they intend to maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne it.</p>
                  <p>Fourtly I proue directly that the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiues euen of thoſe particulars contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted betwixt vs and the profeſſors of the Engliſh Religion, ar fundamental points of faith, and by conſequence that if the Church can erre in them that parte of their new diſtinction is falſe according to which they auerre the Church can not erre in fundamental points of Religion: which I conuince in this forme of argument.</p>
                  <p>That diſtinction is falſe and abſurde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which it neceſſarily followes that the Church can erre in matters the true faith of which is neceſſarie to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But according to the diſtinction of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, and not fundamental matters
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2119:377"/> of faith it neceſſarily followes the Church can erre in matters neceſſarie to ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Ergo The diſtinction of fundamental, and not fundamental matters of faith, is a falſe and abſurde diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>The minor in which the total difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conſiſts, I proue becauſe according to this diſtinction, the Church may erre in theſe propoſitions. The Church hath the true complete Canon of ſcripture, The Church hath the true interpretation and ſenſe of ſcripture. Chriſts bodie and bloud ar truely, really, ſubſtantially, and not by onely faith contained in the ſacred Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt &amp;c. And yet the faith of theſe either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiuely or negatiuely, is neceſſarie to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the aduerſaries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues if they will not be occounted obſtinate in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſoe cleare and manifeſt, can not denye. Therfore it is hence concluded by forcible ſequele that their diſtinction of fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and not fundamentals in matters of faith is falſe and abſurde.</p>
                  <p>Fiftely, I reaſon in this manner againſt the ſame diſtinction. If the infallibilitie of the Churches authoritie conſiſtes in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points of Religion onely, and not in all that the true Church ſhal at anie tyme declare vnto her members concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their faith and Religion, then were
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2119:377"/> not t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e prouidence of Chriſt perfect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his ſponſe, but more defectiue then God was towardes the ſynagog of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, neither were this anie other then to imagine that Chriſt in deede did laye a ſounde foundation for his Church, but lefte walles and roofe expoſed to be deiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or caſte to grounde with euerie puffe of winde which how repugnant to reaſon &amp; his owne inuiolable promiſſe this is, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may eaſily conſider, and cenſure.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, I argue yet more poſitiuely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the diſtinction related becauſe, our aduerſaries frame it either in reſpect of the greater, or leſſer dignitie of the obiects of fundamental and not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points of faith in them ſelues, or in reſpect of the greater or leſſe neceſſitie of them to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by reaſon of the neceſſitie of faith which the members of the true Church haue of them all and euerie one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, Now if we reſpect onely the material obiects in them ſelues, and the neceſſitie of them to ſaluation preciſely, ſoe I confeſſe ther ar ſome particular matters of faith which much ſurpaſſe orhers, and in that reſpect alſoe the one may not vnaptely be termed fundamental in compariſion of the reſt which haue not that preheminencie. For example that ther is a God, and that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2119:378"/> God is a rewarder of workes quod <hi>Deus est, &amp; remunerator ſit.</hi> That he is one in three perſons, that the ſecond perſon in Trinitie became incarnate or tooke humaine nature vpon him, was borne of the Virgin Marie, ſuffered death for our dedemption &amp;c. are matters both more noble and dignifiable in them ſelues, then thoſe: Chriſt faſted fortie dayes, and fortie nights, an Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in his agonie, Peter denyed Chriſt, and other ſuch like truthes, Yet this how true ſoeuer it bee, it is nothing to the purpoſe which here we treate, nor afordeth anie grounde or foundation for the preno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated diſtinction of our aduerſaries, in regarde that althou' ther be neuer ſoe great difference among thoſe and other points of Religion in the dignitie of the material ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, by reaſon of which in ſome ſorte the one may be named fundamental, the other not fundamental: neuertheleſſe becauſe the faith of the one is no leſſe neceſſarie to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then the faith of the other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is that abſolutely the one is as much funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental as the other and conſequently ther ar no not fundamentals in matters of faith as the diſtinction of out aduerſaries doth falſely ſuppoſe.</p>
                  <p>And hence in like manner it farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth, that if the Church ſhould erre but
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2119:378"/> onely in the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or propoſition euen of thoſe matters of leſſe qualitie, the error would be directly againſt diuine faith, and conſequently the Church in this caſe ſhould truely be ſaid to haue erred eued in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points of faith, and in matters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſaluation, fundamental points, as I haue declared and often repeated, being no other then all thoſe reuailed truethes the faith of which is neceſſarie in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church for the obtaining of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, not obſtanding anie difference which otherwiſe may apppeare in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſeueral obiects or matters, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing no one parte but the whole intyre faith of Chriſt and euerie parte and partiall of thoſe verities which he hath reuailed to his Church, is the foundation of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and Catholique Religion, it being as neceſſarie to ſaluation for euerie true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to beleeue truely and ſyncerely if it be propoſed vnto him by the Church that the cocke crowed at the tyme of S Peters denyal of Chriſt, or that a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier lanced our ſauiors ſide with a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are, as that he dyed vpon the Croſſe for our redemption, and riſſe againe for our iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>But Finally, If peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture our aduerſaries ſhould ſay that within the compaſſe of true
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2119:379"/> faith ſome things be neceſſarie to ſaluation and others not neceſſarie, and that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſome things be fundamental, but others not.</p>
                  <p>To this inſtance I replye, it is founded in a manifeſt equiuocation. For althou' it is true that their be ſome, things within the compaſſe of ſaith which ar not neceſſarie for euerie member of the Church to kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we them expreſſely, yet is it neceſſarie to ſaluation for euerie faithfull Chriſtian thou' neuer ſoe ſimple or ignorant, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue euerie parte and partiall of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects or matters which God hath reuailed, if for ſuch by the Church they be propoſed vnto him, otherwiſe he ſhould incurre the cenſure of that ſtrict and fearefull ſentence of the moſt iuſte and equal iudge Chriſt our Sauior, <hi>qui vero non crediderit condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur:</hi> and ſoe the faith euen of all thoſe things which euerie one by reaſon of his ſtate or condition of life, or for want of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is not obledged to knowe, is neceſſarie to ſaluation, and conſequently all kinde of faith of what matter ſoeuer it be that God hath reuailed, is as much fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall as is faith of the greateſt matter or myſterie of the whole Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleefe: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce it is that as S. Gregorie Nazianzen trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the vnitie and integritie of faith in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2119:379"/> his 39. oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboute the ende declareth by example or ſimilitude that faith is like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a goulden chaine connected and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of diuers linkes, from which if you take anie one away, you looſe your ſaluation as S. Ambroſe in the ende of hir ſixt kooke vpon the Euangell of S. Luke declares. By which it is manifeſte that faith of euerie point or matter within the compaſſe of faith, is neceſſarie to ſaluation and therfore fundamental abſolutely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the obiect be great or little, and no faith not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal, as the new diſtinction of the Nouelliſts moſt falſely affirmes: which ther diſtinction doubtneſſe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by them to the ende they might ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue a more plauſible coulor to accuſe the Roman Church of errors comitted in faith, (as alſoe for excuſe of ther owne) their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and irreligion being ſo great that like vnconſcionable taylers they choſe rather to cutte out a Church for Chriſt of ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſtuffe as this, then to liue or dye vnreuenged of the Catholique Roman Church.</p>
                  <p>And for concluſion I adde that ſince I haue made manifeſt by theſe my reaſons that the faith euen of thoſe points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which our aduerſaries terme not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, is abſolutely required to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2119:380"/> of euerie Chriſtian ſoule, if euen in rheſe particulars onely the Church could erre, none could aſſuredly be perſuaded that by makeing them ſelues members of it, they ar in the certaine &amp; infallible way to the obteining of eternal bleſſednes, but ſtill ſhould remaine in the like dangerous &amp; deſperate ſtate they did before they were in the Church of Chriſt, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently by reaſon of this vncertaintie &amp; perill a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall neglect of procuring to enter in to the true Church of Chriſt would be cauſed in the mindes of men, which inconuenience in regarde it proceedes by inauoiable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from this diſtinction broached &amp; vſed by our aduerſaries, it plainely appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res the doctrine of it is in diuers reſpect moſt pernicious &amp; damnable as not ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in anie ſorte to the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, as is by them pretended, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectely to the ruine &amp; deſtruction of it.<note place="margin">

                  <p>S.

But the true &amp; obuious ſenſe of that diuine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in the cited place onely is, that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual men muſt not iudge anie thing contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſcripture (as preſently he ſubioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) <hi>non rite veraciterque dictum eſſe,</hi> that is, <hi>not to be ritely &amp; truelly ſpoken,</hi> but ſubmit their vnderſtanding, <hi>etiamſi quid ibi non lucet</hi> altou' ſome thing be not cleare, or perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in it. This is the pure &amp; ſyncere ſenſe of S.

                  <p>S. Chriſoſtome like wiſe, and S.

S. Chriſoſtome onely treates in thoſe places of twoe particular caſes, to wit in the Geneſis he argueth againſt ſome whoe denyed the terreſtriall Paradiſe, and vpon the foreſaid Epiſtle of ſaint Paule, he reprehendes ſome others who were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the ſoule is a particle of the diuine nature. And touching theſe two particular points S. Chryſoſtome affirmes that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſcripture expondes it ſelfe, and ſuffers not the reader to erre, but he ſaid not that the ſcripture in all other places and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters doth ſoe interpret it ſelfe as Sir Humfrey falſely alledgeth.</p>
                  <p>Now S. Ambroſe ſaying that the dore ſhall be opened vnto him who dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly exame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the difficult and obſcure paſſages of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by no other but by the worde of God, he doth not there meane by the worde of God the ſcriptures them ſelues, but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine word that is Chriſt our ſauior the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in Trinitie, and therfore he
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2119:382"/> addes to the wordes cited by Sir Humfrey. <hi>de quo legisti in Apocalipſi quod Agnus librum ſignatam aperuit,</hi> of which thou haeſt read in the Apocalips. that the lambe opened the ſealed booke, which laſte wordes of S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe becauſe the knight perceiued that by their plaine explication of the former, they diſcouered the whole ſentence to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his purpoſe, he deceitfull ſmun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and left them vnrehearſed by which his palpable and groſſe abuſe of theſe two graue and ancient authors doth euidently appeare.</p>
                  <p>An much according to this faſhion he proceeds with Pope Clement whome he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in the ſame place, and for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Whoe neuertheleſſe is ſoe repugnant to the tenet of the nouelliſts in making the ſole ſcripture interpreter of it ſelfe in all caſes, that he expreſſely teaches that we muſt not according to our owne ſenſe but, <hi>ſecundum traditionem patris,</hi> according to the tradition of the Father, that is either accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the tradition of the Pope him ſelfe as deliuerer of the ſenſe of ſcriptures vnto vs, or <hi>ſecundum traditionem Patris,</hi> that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tradition of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and therfore he addes afterwardes. <hi>&amp; ideo oportet ab eo intelligentiam diſcere ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam qui eum a maioribus ſecundum veritatem<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2119:383"/> ſibi traditam reſeruauit vt ipſe poſſit ea quae recte ſuſcepit cempetenter aſſerere.</hi> That is, And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to learne the intelligence or vnderſtanding of ſcriptures of him whoe reſerued it to him ſelfe according to the trueth deliuered vnto him by his ancetors to the end he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petently aſſert tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe things which he ritely receiued.</p>
                  <p>But Sir Humfrey conceiled theſe wordes, as alſoe the greater parte of the period out of which he cited thoſe wordes he alledges, yet ioined vnto them the reſt of thoſe which he rehearſeth, not obſtanding they ar parte of an other clauſe, alſoe adding the worde <hi>ſeeing</hi> which neither is in the authors text, nor agrees with his ſenſe and meaning, which is not that the ſcripture alone is an intyre and firme rule of faith, but the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expounded according to the ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from the ancients, as immediately before he affirmed. But vaine Sir Humfrey was ſoe deſirous to ſeeme to his reader to haue a Pope for an a better of his poſition, that he chuſed rather to proſtitute his owne honeſtie in the euill vſe he made of his authoritie, then ſeeme to wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie of ſoe renowned a perſonage. And yet is the knight ſoe farre from obtaining his purpoſe, that if the wordes were not ſoe manie that they can not with conueniencie
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2119:383"/> be intyrely related, they them ſelues would make it apparent how much the author of them is abuſed by the falſe relater. The ſupplye of which I remit to the more diligent reader as tyme &amp; leaſure ſhall giue him occaſion.</p>
                  <p>But I confeſſe now I am quite tired with the examen of my aduerſaries miſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged teſtimonies of the authors he produces in fauor of his miſremormed doctrine and muſt needs draw my ſelfe to a concluſion of my labors, hoping I need not doubte but by theſe fewe paſſages the reader will eaſily perſuade him ſelfe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reſt they ar all of the ſame nature and ſoe be ſatisfyed with that implicit or general knowledge he will haue of them by this meanes, and his owne diſcourſe, althou perhaps by his owne induſtrie and inquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is not able in particular to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the fraudes and come to the true ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and menning of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in anie more expreſſe and declared manner. Yet if my aduerſarie him ſelfe will not be ſatisfyed with this compendious courſe I haue vſed, but will farther require an cxacte anſer to euerie particular allegation, vpon condition he will firſt iuſtifye his proceeding in theſe I haue ſhewed defectiue, I promiſſe with Gods
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2119:384"/> aſſiſtance I will be readie both to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſoe much as I haue alreadie done and ſaid, and alſoe to proceed farther in my view and cenſure of thoſe places which as yet I haue not touched if God be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to giue me health and opportunitie of bookes, theſe being rhe greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I haue had im the performance of the worke.</p>
                  <p>To omit the printe which is well knowne what a trouble in is vnto tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of our Religion and nation, and how great an adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tange our aduerſaries ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of vs in theſe particulars, ſome of vs being forced to paſſe the ſeaes for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſmale matter we haue to publiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes the perill of importing the bookes into the countrie, which is ſubiect to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerable caſualities and daungers of moleſtation for the ſame as experience doth teſtifye, God almightie amend it and reſtrore vs to our ancient Catholique liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Religion.</p>
                  <p>And to returne to thee proceeding of my aduerſarie I ſay for a man ſome tymes inculpably to erre, or myſtake ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in wordes or ſenſe eſpecially in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate matters, I doe not admire it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dare I iuſtifye my ſelfe in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2119:384"/> (I let paſſe the faultes of the printer to which euerie one is ſubiect) but that one ſhould erre ſoe frequently and groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely as Sir Humfrey hath erred in his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of all ſortes of authors both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and moderne in the whole diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of his two bookes, and yet neuer in fauor of his aduerſaries, but euer in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor of his owne cauſe, this I ſay is no way excuſable, and in my opinion it is ſuch a fortune as chanceth to no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture excepting him ſelfe, or ſome of his illuminate brothers.</p>
                  <p>That which I ſoe much the more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deplore in regarde he hath not onely ſuffered his owne proper iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inſotted with ſuch inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate deluſions but likewiſe, as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by reporte of others, hath by the ſame preſtigious ſleightes deliuered his owne neareſt and deareſt freind his inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous ladie, whoſe otherwiſe well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and once Catholike iudgement, if yet he had conuinced by ſyncere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and honeſt vſe of ſcriptures. Fathers, and other writers, it had ben leſſe intolerable, but to winne her with ſuch falſe wares as theſe, is an action no way iuſtifiable either before God or men.</p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:2119:385"/>
                  <p>And if I might be admitted to your Counſell Sir Humfrey, I would aduiſe you to ceaſe writing bookes in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is neither your profeſſion neither as I conceiue, and am informed, ar you able to performe anie ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke without the aſſiſtance of tutors which muſt of neceſſitie be chargeable vnto you. A dozen or ſixteene of the Puritan Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie will quickely make a greate hole in an ordinarie knights eſtate, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they be aſſembled in ſuch a place as the wine office, which as the verie ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of the worde denotes, neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes much good fellowſhip and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently great expenſe. Beware of that black garde, they will haunte your houſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſo maine ill ſpirits, not ſo much by night as by day: they ar meridian ſpirits, they aſſaulte moſt in the mideſt of the leight, therby to daſle mens eyes more eaſily, aboute dinner tyme you ſhal be ſure to haue them moſt buſie aboute you.</p>
                  <p>For as a conceited Proteſtant reportes. <hi>Where the meat is best ther a Puritan confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes most, for</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>his arguing is but the efficacie of his eating, and the Pope he beſt concludes against in plum broth.</hi> This conſell proceedes from a freind, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2119:385"/> if you pleaſe to make vſe of it, the profit will be your owne, the thankes due to mee. This is now the third anſer your firſt booke hath receiued by men of three ſeueral profeſſions, by a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, a preiſt, an a clerke, <hi>triplex fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis difficile rumpitur</hi> which cordes I hope will tye your iudgement with in the boundes of reaſon. Fare you well Sir Humfrey in Chriſt our Sauior, and receiue this as from him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing more then your moſte happie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, &amp; ſempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes.</p>
